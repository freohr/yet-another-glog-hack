# Twenty System Questions

[From Necropraxis](https://www.necropraxis.com/2012/02/24/20-quick-questions-rules/)

1. Ability scores generation method?
    * [Using Knave's generation, 3d6 in order, lowest die of 3 as attribute bonus](rules/CharacterCreation.md#1-Roll-your-stats)
2. How are death and dying handled?
    * [Dismemberment at full damage, Death if more damage](rules/PlayerRules.md)
3. What about raising the dead?
    * If you find the needed long lost rituals, you can certainly try.
4. How are replacement PCs handled?
    * Players can take over Henchfolks, or roll new characters. Backup experience (dedicated extra xp from treasure) allows quick lvl up for new PCs.
5. Initiative: individual, group, or something else?
    * Derivative of Group initiative: the group with initiative declares action after everyone else, actions are resolved simultaneously
6. Are there critical hits and fumbles? How do they work?
    * Mishaps with Action dices (on doubles), no critical success, no critical failures.
7. Do I get any benefits for wearing a helmet?
    * +1 AC, Dwarves can splinter their Helmet the same way adventurers can splinter their shield to negate damage
8. Can I hurt my friends if I fire into melee or do something similarly silly?
    * With missiles weapons no, with area effects yes (Fireballs don't discriminate, neither do burning oil).
9. Will we need to run from some encounters, or will we be able to kill everything?
    * Not necessarily kill everything, but classes with Fighting Dice are good at fighting (who knew?). You also don't gain any XP from the combat itself, only diegetic advancement (access to more treasure, rewards, etc.).
10. Level-draining monsters: yes or no?
    * No, maybe rare attributes draining creatures.
11. Are there going to be cases where a failed save results in PC death?
    * At most, it will be "Save or Roll on dismemberment table"
12. How strictly are encumbrance & resources tracked?
    * Yes, as planning what to bring and how to carry it is an important part of the sandbox. Encumbrance is using slots, instead of pounds, to simplify tracking it.
    * Depletable resources are Food, Water, Light and Arrows/Bolts, they are tracked on usage.
13. Whatâ€™s required when my PC gains a level? Training? Do I get new spells automatically? Can it happen in the middle of an adventure, or do I have to wait for down time?
    * Downtime training for level up. Arcane Magic user gains a new spell during training. As XP is only counted when coming back to town, no level up in the middle of an adventure.
14. What do I get experience for?
    * Recovering treasure and bringing it back to the safety of a civilized town.
15. How are traps located? Description, dice rolling, or some combination?
    * Describing if and how you search works, even when not, traps only trigger at 2-in-6. Disarming traps requires description and rolls.
16. Are retainers encouraged and how does morale work?
    * Henchfolks are strongly recommended, as they can take over dead/retired PCs. Hirelings are also recommended, as they can carry stuff, bring additional arms to fight, offer expertise, etc.
17. How do I identify magic items?
    * Magic Users can perceive an item as magic at first glance, full identification requires downtime, experimentation always work (few items are cursed, and those are usually sufficiently described)
18. Can I buy magic items? Oh, come on: how about just potions?
    * Items no, but potions and scrolls yes (also blank spellbooks if you need to). Also it's expensive.
19. Can I create magic items? When and how?
    * Magic Users (people with Magic Dice) can infuse scrolls, wands and staves with spells. True Magic Items requires downtime and specific materials.
20. What about splitting the party?
    * You can, but it means less people to face the dangers of exploration. Also please don't, for my sanity as referee.
