## Corrections

- [ ] Put every rolling mechanic as "High == Good for the player": Attack, Skill, Morale, etc.
- [ ] Check if "+ ToHit" on class of weapons is better than comparing AC and Roll to determine Major Injuries.
  - [ ] Actually find a good system that makes weapons attack interact with the Injury system
- [ ] Rework Fighter damaging features to work with Wounds system
- [ ] Maybe adapt/import level 0 rules from Lair of the Lamb?
- [ ] Remove Resilience Column from level advancement (resistance to wounds linked to inventory)
