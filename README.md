# HexaGLOG

The Hexagonal Goblin Laws of gaming (because hexagons are bestagons).

## Introduction

### What this game is about

This game is an OSR game, which means it comes with a set of assumption about gameplay. More details in the [Agendas page](rules/agendas.md)

- Emergent story, based on player interaction with the world.
- Dungeoneering, Adventuring and Exploring the wilderness in a Fantasy World.
- Playing mortal adventurers relying on their wits to survive.
- Braving danger for treasure with clever strategies.
- Team effort, as survival is far from certain when adventuring alone.

### What this game is not about

- Following a pre-existing narrative
- Thespian roleplaying.
- Exploring inter-personal relationships between PCs, other PCs, and/or NPCs.

### What are the difference from other GLOG hacks

- **Roll high**: For every kind of roll, high is better. From Knave, every skill check or save is roll >= 15; Moral and reaction is 2d10, with high means more favorable results; Overloaded Encounter Die have better result on high values; etc.
- **Character stats are bonuses only**. Any roll is: grab the needed die, roll, add a attribute bonus, then compare the result to the threshold for the kind of action you rolled for. ([Ok, fine, it's not that different](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/stat-squish-and-lawful-roll.html))
- **Player-facing rolls**: Beside referee-only rolls (mostly procedural generation), all rolls are done by the player, including attacking and defending in combat.
- **More templates for an adventurer**: Classes still only have 4 templates, but PCs can have up to 6 templates, which means multi-classing will happen if you survive long enough.
- **Ancestry-as-templates** (derived from Race-as-Class): To replicate the original old school D&D games, every PC is a human, unless they take Ancestry templates, representing their belonging to a different ancestry, culture, etc.
- **No HP**. Instead, damage is represented by injuries taking up inventory space: The more damage you take between rests, the less stuff you can carry.
