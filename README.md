# HexaGLOG

The Hexagonal Goblin Laws of gaming (because hexagons are bestagons).

## Introduction

### What this game is about

This game is an OSR game, which means it comes with a set of assumption about gameplay. More details in the [Agendas page](rules/agendas.md)

- Emergent story, based on player interaction with the world.
- Dungeoneering, Adventuring and Exploring the wilderness in a Fantasy World.
- Playing mortal adventurers relying on their wits to survive.
- Braving danger for treasure with clever strategies.
- Team effort, as survival is far from certain when adventuring alone.

### What this game is not about

- Following a pre-existing narrative
- Thespian roleplaying.
- Exploring inter-personal relationships between PCs, other PCs, and/or NPCs.
