## Weapon attacks

* Go full "Into the Odd", and remove the roll to hit?
  * Weapons are d6, d8, d10
  * Roll for player attack is +STR -Enemy ARM
  * Roll for player defense is +Enemy ATK (-ARM -CON) <- write this as DEF?
  * Result is the injury suffered; if <= 0, no injury
* For injuries outside combat:
  * Injuries are "d12 +`# injuries`-CON"
  * Minor Injuries are "d6 + `# injuries` - CON"
