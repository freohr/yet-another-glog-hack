# Intents of the Game

## Goals: What the intended style of play is

This ruleset intends to create a specific kind of gameplay at the table: player-driven, campaign-length, low-heroic adventuring in an Points-of-Light fantasy open-world sandbox.

Let's break down what each part of this means :

* **Player-driven**
    1. There is no pre-planned narrative, expected story, or plots coming from the Referee/DM
    2. Players need to have goals of their own, and can and will change them, fulfill them, abandon them, and discover other goals during the campaign.
* **Campaign-length**:
    1. A game supported by this ruleset is intended to take place over multiple sessions, during which PCs will interact with different parts of the world, and evolve according to the will and intents of the Players.
* **low-heroic**:
    1. As opposed to Heroic (larger than life characters expected to succeed) and Super-Heroic (Characters beyond human expectation dealing with extraordinary situations)
    2. PCs start a bit more competent than the norm (Fighters know what to do with a sword to hurt others, Magic-Users can use 1 arcane spell per day and know how to research magic, Specialists know which tools are useful for adventure and how to use them), but are still mortal and severely disadvantaged when adventuring alone.
    3. They become Heroes to the level of Aragorn (his whole character arc from Ranger to King of Gondor is actually a good representation of the expected path for PCs, disregarding the fact that he is "supposed" to be king as the lost heir) or Conan (from Barbarian to King) over the course of the entire campaign.
* **Adventuring**:
    1. The primary kind of actual gameplay at the table will be PCs interacting with the "Non-Civilized" part of the world in order to gain the means of accomplishing their goals.
    2. Exploring characters personalities and psyche are not a part of the play, and would be at best a side-effect of the adventuring.
* **Points of Light**:
    1. There is no overarching current, working empire/civilization that rules over the land and that players can interact with either in the frozen far north or the equatorial islands.
       1. Note that this also applies for several concurrent "big" civilizations: In the expected setting, there is no civilization that controls lands at the scale of a modern country (ok, maybe at the scale of Andorra or the Vatican, i.e. big fortified cities disguised as countries).
    2. The civilized lands are only present around keeps, castles, settlements and towns. For each of those "Points of Light", merely a small region can be considered mostly safe around them (about a 6 miles radius, or a belt of 1 hex around the settlement).
    3. The rest of the world is Wilderness, Lawlessness (both exempt from actual law, and non-Lawful from the perspective of the Cosmic Conflict of "Law against Chaos") and Danger.
    4. Most people are afraid of straying too far from settlements.
    5. Adventurers are considered by some as Fearless Heroes, for braving the Wilds, or as Reckless Fools by others, for wanting to explore the dangerous world and dying doing so.
* **Fantasy**
    1. Mystical creatures and magic are part of the world.
    2. Technology level is low: There is no industrialized equipment in the world, be it either as a steam-powered engine or as gunpowder. Magic may be used at some places to replicate technology, but it is costly, rare, and subject to the whims of Wizards.
    3. The Divine is present, represented by a cosmopolite pantheon of deities that people pray to as needed (to a God of the Harvest, a Goddess of the Ale, a Patron of Blacksmiths, etc.)
* **Open-world sandbox**
    1. There is no dedicated adventuring site: Everything is the adventuring region. Players must decide among themselves where they want to go adventuring.
    2. Travel is explicit, risky, and takes time. PCs can expect to stumble onto unexpected encounters and sites while travelling.
    3. Any kind of player action takes time, and the world adjust to passing time.

## Methods: How the intended style of play is created

### What the Game gives to you, the Player

#### PC Tools

PCs, as defined be the rules, are a bundle of tools for the player to use to interact with the world. Those tools are separated in 2 categories :

1. Intrinsic: Tools (or actually, Features) that cannot be separated from the PC.
   * Those are either innate (given to you at the beginning): e.g. Attributes rolled at character creation, and stats derived from that; or acquired (chosen by you): Your class templates, anything you can decide during levelling: Which template you take and its associated features, How you increase your attributes, Action Dice, etc.
   * Note that even a character death cannot "separate" those features from a PC: The lost PC's features are no longer accessible, and you use another PC with their own set of intrinsic features
2. Extrinsic: Tools that can be given to and taken from the PC.
   * This encompasses both actual tools (any gear you are carrying) and allegorical tools (Hirelings and Henchfolks, Relations with Factions, etc.).
   * Any kind of settlement/keep/castle/mage tower that the PCs might build or manage are also considered tools.

Those tools are never (or rather, not intended to be) a one-button answer to any situation that the PCs encounter: They merely provide options, not solutions. The answer is not on your character sheet.

> This means that you won't find a "Survival", a "Diplomacy" or a "Lockpicking" skill (or any explicit skill actually) in those rules that enables "I am good at doing the specific thing, therefore I do the specific thing". It also means that:
>
> * a) To do something, you have to think about what you want to do, describe it to the table, explain how you do it, and say what you want to gain from it; all of this in the context of the in-game world,
> * b) Anything on your character sheet is polyvalent (e.g. Magic Dice are primarily used to cast magic, but you could expend one to help you with a skill check to identify magic you encounter)

Action Dice are one way of making it possible to specialize a character, without trivializing what the player intends for the character to do: A PC with Fighting Dice is better at fighting that one without, but Dice alone does not guarantee victory. Template features are another, but they work in a different way: with the exception of templates granting Magic, templates only enhance mechanics already present in the game, e.g. even if a fighter (with the B template) is better at handling Hirelings, it doesn't mean that you need to be a fighter to have access to hirelings; a PC with a good Charisma would be just as effective.

> Side Note here regarding Magic: Magic is the only feature in this game that says "If you don't explicitly choose a class that can do that, you can't do that". Everything else is merely "You are better at doing that thing that people that don't specialize in doing that thing".

### How the Game restricts you, the PC

#### Mechanically

##### Play Structures

Play structures are both a tool and a restriction. They serve to frame and organize both play at the table, and PCs actions in the world.

##### The Inventory

The most important part of your character sheet is the **Inventory**:

* You want to bring something to the adventure, put it in your inventory;
* You want to take something back from the adventure, put it in your inventory;
* You get hurt while adventuring, put the injury in your inventory (not diegetically of course, but injuries are tracked in your inventory, and take the place of anything else you might be carrying).

However, your inventory size is limited by your Attributes, and if you carry more than your Attributes allows you, you will be severely penalized.

##### The Dice

#### Diegetically

This is more of a soft restriction, rather than a hard rule.

##### The Scale of Power

PCs are competent humans, not superheroes. Moving a boulder may be done with either enough people, enough horsepower, or with ingenious leverage using the surrounding environment, but moving a mountain is impossible within this ruleset. Magic may skew this a little (moving TWO boulders, imagine that?), but still isn't omnipotent.

##### Time

> YOU CAN NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.

There, everything is said.

...

Fine, maybe some clarifying is needed.

Every action of the PCs take time, and the PCs have a limited range of action they can take during a specific period. Combat rounds, Dungeon turns, Wilderness watches serve as both game turns, to structure how players can act, and as a measure of the passing of time: As a watch is 4h, you can only explore during 4 of the 6 watches of a day (you still need to rest and sleep the remaining 2); As a turn is 10min, you can only take 24 turns in a watch. Furthermore, the act of levelling up also takes time (2 week of forced downtime), recovering from injuries takes time (from a few days to several weeks), etc.

During this passing time, in which PCs act, the rest of the world still moves forwards: NPCs with plans advances them, Cleared dungeons get restocked, Factions interact with each other at a bigger scale.
