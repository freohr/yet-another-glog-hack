# Intents of the Game

## Goals: What the intended style of play is

This ruleset intends to create a specific kind of gameplay at the table: player-driven, campaign-length, low-heroic adventuring in a Points-of-Light fantasy open-world sandbox.

Let's break down what each part of this means :

* **Player-driven**
    1. As opposed to GM-driven
       1. There is no pre-planned narrative, expected story, or plots of any kind coming from the Referee/DM
       2. Players need to have goals of their own, and can and will change them, fulfill them, abandon them, and discover other goals during the campaign.
       3. The Referee is only here to be an neutral arbiter of the rules and the environment, not a facilitator of the Narrative.
    2. As opposed to Character-driven
       1. This game is intended to be played as player skill against a verisimilar, power-unbalanced but fair world, represented through the Referee.
       2. Character Personal Arcs, character motivations, etc. are not the focus of the campaign, i.e. "This is what my character would do", be it thought reasonably or said defensively, is a mindset to be avoided in the kind of gameplay this game wants to provide.
* **Campaign-length**:
    1. A game supported by this ruleset is intended to take place over multiple sessions, during which PCs will interact with different parts of the world, and evolve according to the will and intents of the Players.
* **low-heroic**:
    1. As opposed to Heroic (larger than life characters expected to succeed) and Super-Heroic (Characters beyond human expectation dealing with extraordinary situations)
    2. PCs start a bit more competent than the norm (Fighters know what to do with a sword to hurt others, Magic-Users can use 1 arcane spell per day and know how to research magic, Specialists know which tools are useful for adventure and how to use them), but are still mortal and severely disadvantaged when adventuring alone.
    3. They become Heroes to the level of Aragorn (his whole character arc from Ranger to King of Gondor is actually a good representation of the expected path for PCs, disregarding the fact that he is "supposed" to be king as the lost heir) or Conan (from Barbarian to King) over the course of the entire campaign.
* **Adventuring**:
    1. The primary kind of actual gameplay at the table will be PCs interacting with the "Non-Civilized" part of the world in order to gain the means of accomplishing their goals.
    2. Exploring characters personalities and psyche are not a part of the play, and would be at best a side-effect of the adventuring.
* **Points of Light**:
    1. There is no overarching current, working empire/civilization that rules over the land and that players can interact with either in the frozen far north or the equatorial islands.
       1. Note that this also applies for several concurrent "big" civilizations: In the expected setting, there is no civilization that controls lands at the scale of a modern country (ok, maybe at the scale of Andorra or the Vatican, i.e. big fortified cities disguised as countries).
    2. The civilized lands are only present around keeps, castles, settlements and towns. For each of those "Points of Light", merely a small region can be considered mostly safe around them (about a 6 miles radius, or a belt of 1 hex around the settlement).
    3. The rest of the world is Wilderness, Lawlessness (both exempt from actual law, and non-Lawful from the perspective of the Cosmic Conflict of "Law against Chaos") and Danger.
    4. Most people are afraid of straying too far from settlements.
    5. Adventurers are considered by some as Fearless Heroes, for braving the Wilds, or as Reckless Fools by others, for wanting to explore the dangerous world and dying doing so.
* **Fantasy**
    1. Mystical creatures and magic are part of the world.
    2. Technology level is low: There is no industrialized equipment in the world, be it either as a steam-powered engine or as gunpowder. Magic may be used at some places to replicate technology, but it is costly, rare, and subject to the whims of Wizards.
    3. The Divine is present, represented by a cosmopolite pantheon of deities that people pray to as needed (to a God of the Harvest, a Goddess of the Ale, a Patron of Blacksmiths, etc.)
* **Open-world sandbox**
    1. There is no dedicated adventuring site: Everything is the adventuring region. Players must decide among themselves where they want to go adventuring.
    2. Travel is explicit, risky, and takes time. PCs can expect to stumble onto unexpected encounters and sites while travelling.
    3. Any kind of player action takes time, and the world adjust to passing time.
    4. The world simply is: It is not intended to be balanced against the player, merely against itself (e.g. Dragons are dangerous, may be encountered as early as the first ever adventure, and hoard a lot of treasure in their lairs)

## Methods: How the intended style of play is created

### Rules

The rules serve as as a mechanical framing of the power of the characters (by explicitly covering restrictions) and as a foundation on which the players' reasonable actions are adjudicated by the referee. They are not covering everything a player and/or PC can do, and are not intended to be.

#### Rules as Player Tools

Rules about character usage are directly aimed at players, for them to build their own mechanical toolkit. This encompasses character creation choices, class features, rules about magic, hired help, etc.

#### Rules as Referee Tools

Those rules are for the referee to help them adjudicate the players' action: How to handle Reactions from NPCs, how to handle Morale, the standard difficulty for a PC skill check or save, etc.

#### Rules as Player Restrictions

This part of the rules is intended to put limits to what player can do, and also to set the tone of the kind of game the rules want to create.

##### How to handle carried gear and items

As finding treasure and carrying it back is central to this game, Inventory management is important. There are 3 things that goes into a PC's inventory over the course of the game:

1. **Equipment**: Tools, consumables and class specific items take up slots as you carry them during the adventure. Most items take 1 slot, some may be bundled to carry more than 1 per slot, and a few exception may take 2 or more slots. Worn equipment does not count in your inventory, except for metal armor (e.g. Chainmail and Platemail), for which it represents effort adventuring with donned armor.
   * Depletable and indispensable resources like food, water and light are part of your adventuring equipment, and you will need them in the wilderness.
2. **Treasure**: When you find treasure during an adventure, be it coins or precious items, they also fill slots in your inventory. This means that you need to balance your load between equipment you bring in, and treasure you bring back.
3. **Injuries**: Technically not items, but still counted in your inventory. This system does not have Hit Points, preferring instead to track injuries metaphorically filling your inventory to represent your PC getting worn out by adventuring and battle.

However, Inventory is limited: your PC's maximum inventory size is related to your Attributes, and only grows slowly over the course of your level ups. Some classes may increase the number of inventory slots for a specific kind of gear (e.g. the Specialist has more space, dedicated to tools and toolkits).

##### How to mechanically advance

PCs can advance in two ways:

1. **Diegetically**, by finding new gear, new allies, more knowledge: This is a mostly horizontal progression, widening the breadth of tools that the player can use, but it may also sometimes be vertical, by finding some specific magic items that grant more power (A sword that deals more vicious injuries, a cursed amulet that grants additional Magic Dice).
2. **Mechanically**, primarily by levelling up, granting more class features, more action dice: This progression is both vertical (you automatically get more Action Dice and increased Attributes) and horizontal (More class features facilitating the use of other rules: A bonus to reaction for your hirelings, a way to create new spells, more inventory space for your tools). Mechanical progress may also happen outside of levelling up for Magic Users, as they may find new spells while adventuring, thus increasing their magical palette of spells.

**Diegetic advancement** is the result of players interacting with the world, and this is mostly restricted by the other part of the rules (Reactions from NPCs, Encumbrance, Play Procedures, etc.). However, **mechanical advancement** is governed by a set of rules, that dictates how you gain XP, how much XP you need, what you need to do to gain that advancement (training with a master), as the benefits are more set in stone, and "guaranteed" by the ruleset.

##### How to handle injuries and death

### Procedures

Procedures are meant to both structure play at the table, and measure time spent diegetically. This ruleset explicitly describes 3 procedures framing players action: Combat, Dungeon Crawling and Wilderness Movement. Using procedures is automatic: If a player or the party wants to do an activity that fits one of the defined procedures, then the procedure is used. This
