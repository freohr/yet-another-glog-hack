# Intents of the Game

## Goals: What the intended style of play is

This ruleset intends to create a specific kind of gameplay at the table: cooperative player-driven, campaign-length, low-heroic adventuring in a Points-of-Light fantasy open-world sandbox.

Let's break down what each part of this means :

* **Cooperative**
    1. Characters are expected to work together to go on adventures. They may still have personal goals (and players are encouraged to create some for their characters), but should those force a character to work against or without the party, the character is then retired (either temporarily until the goal is fulfilled, or permanently, joining the NPC cast of the World), and the player should create a new character which will join the party instead.
    2. As such, this will usually lead into players having multiple characters adventuring in turn: This is a feature of this style of play, and should be embraced by all around the table.
* **Player-driven**
    1. As opposed to GM-driven
       1. There is no pre-planned narrative, expected story, or plots of any kind coming from the Referee/DM
       2. Players need to have goals of their own, and can and will change them, fulfill them, abandon them, and discover other goals during the campaign.
       3. The Referee is only here to be an neutral arbiter of the rules and the environment, not a facilitator of the Narrative.
    2. As opposed to Character-driven
       1. This game is intended to be played as player skill against a verisimilar, power-unbalanced but fair world, represented through the Referee.
       2. Character Personal Arcs, character motivations, etc. are not the focus of the campaign, i.e. "This is what my character would do", be it thought reasonably or said defensively, is a mindset to be avoided in the kind of gameplay this game wants to provide.
* **Campaign-length**:
    1. A game supported by this ruleset is intended to take place over multiple sessions, during which PCs will interact with different parts of the world, and evolve according to the will and intents of the Players.
    2. Domain rules for high level play, even required to advance in level after finishing template training
* **low-heroic**:
    1. As opposed to Heroic (larger than life characters expected to succeed) and Super-Heroic (Characters beyond human expectation dealing with extraordinary situations)
    2. PCs start a bit more competent than the norm (Fighters know how to hurt other without being hit, Magic-Users can use 1 arcane spell per day and know how to research magic, Specialists know which tools are useful for adventure and how to use them), but are still mortal and severely disadvantaged when adventuring alone.
    3. They become Heroes to the level of Aragorn (his whole character arc from Ranger to King of Gondor is actually a good representation of the expected path for PCs, disregarding the fact that he is "supposed" to be king as the lost heir) or Conan (from Barbarian to King) over the course of the entire campaign.
* **Adventuring**:
    1. The primary kind of actual gameplay at the table will be PCs interacting with the "Non-Civilized" part of the world in order to gain the means/wealth needed to accomplish their goals.
    2. Exploring characters personalities and psyche and relationships are not a part of the play, and would be at best a side-effect of the adventuring.
* **Points of Light**:
    1. There is no overarching current, working empire/civilization that rules over the land and that players can interact with either in the frozen far north or the equatorial islands.
       1. Note that this also applies for several concurrent "big" civilizations: In the expected setting, there is no civilization that controls lands at the scale of a modern country (ok, maybe at the scale of Andorra or the Vatican, i.e. big fortified cities disguised as countries).
    2. The civilized lands are only present around keeps, castles, settlements and towns. For each of those "Points of Light", merely a small region can be considered mostly safe around them (about a 6 miles radius, or a belt of 1 hex around the settlement).
    3. The rest of the world is Wilderness, Lawlessness (both exempt from actual law, and non-Lawful from the perspective of the Cosmic Conflict of "Law against Chaos") and Danger.
    4. Most people are afraid of straying too far from settlements.
    5. Adventurers are considered by some as Fearless Heroes, for braving the Wilds, or as Reckless Fools by others, for wanting to explore the dangerous world and dying doing so.
* **Fantasy**
    1. Mystical creatures and magic are part of the world.
    2. Technology level is low: There is no industrialized equipment in the world, be it either as a steam-powered engine or as gunpowder. Magic may be used at some places to replicate technology, but it is costly, rare, and subject to the whims of Wizards.
    3. The Divine is present, represented by a cosmopolite pantheon of deities that people pray to as needed (to a God of the Harvest, a Goddess of the Ale, a Patron of Blacksmiths, etc.)
* **Open-world sandbox**
    1. There is no dedicated adventuring site: Everything is the adventuring region. Players must decide among themselves where they want to go adventuring.
    2. Travel is explicit, risky, and takes time. PCs can expect to stumble onto unexpected encounters and sites while travelling.
    3. Any kind of player action takes time, and the world adjust to passing time.
    4. The world simply is: It is not intended to be balanced against the player, merely against itself (e.g. Dragons are dangerous, may be encountered as early as the first ever adventure, and hoard a lot of treasure in their lairs)

## Methods: How the intended style of play is created

### Rules

The rules serve as as a mechanical framing of the power of the characters (by explicitly covering restrictions) and as a foundation on which the players' reasonable actions are adjudicated by the referee. They are not covering everything a player and/or PC can do, and are not intended to be.

#### Rules as Player Tools

PCs, as defined be the rules, are a bundle of tools for the player to use to interact with the world. Those tools are separated in 2 categories :

1. Intrinsic: Tools (or actually, Features) that cannot be separated from the PC.
   * Those are either innate (given to you at the beginning): e.g. Attributes rolled at character creation, and stats derived from that; or acquired (chosen by you, mostly during level up): Which class template you take and its associated features, How you increase your attributes, Hit Dice, etc.
   * Note that even a character death cannot "separate" those features from a PC: The lost PC's features are no longer accessible, and you use another PC with their own set of intrinsic features.
2. Extrinsic: Tools that can be given to and taken from the PC.
   * This encompasses both actual tools (any gear you are carrying) and metaphorical tools (Hirelings and Henchfolks, Relations with Factions, etc.).
   * Any kind of settlement/keep/castle/mage tower that the PCs might build or manage are also considered tools.

Those tools are never (or rather, not intended to be) a one-button answer to any situation that the PCs encounter: They merely provide options, not solutions. The answer is not on your character sheet.

> This means that you won't find a "Survival", a "Diplomacy" or a "Lockpicking" skill (or any explicit skill actually) in those rules that enables "I am good at doing the specific thing, therefore I do the specific thing".
> For example, the base "Skill" class is the Specialist, and their main way of being better as skill is being able to use Action Dice for skill checks, and being able to carry more tools (which then give bonus for skill checks).
> It also means that:
>
> * a) To do something, you have to think about what you want to do, describe it to the table, explain how you do it, and say what you want to gain from it; all of this in the context of the in-game world,
> * b) Anything on your character sheet is polyvalent (e.g. Magic Dice are primarily used to cast magic, but you could expend one to help you with a skill check to identify magic you encounter)

Action Dice are one way of making it possible to specialize a character, without trivializing what the player intends for the character to do: A PC with Fighting Dice is better at fighting that one without, but Dice alone does not guarantee victory. Template features are another, but they work in a different way: with the exception of templates granting Magic, templates only enhance mechanics already present in the game, e.g. even if a fighter (with the B template) is better at handling Hirelings, it doesn't mean that you need to be a fighter to have access to hirelings; a PC with a good Charisma would be just as effective.

> Side Note here regarding Magic: Magic is the only feature in this game that says "If you don't explicitly choose a class that can do that, you can't do that". Everything else is merely "You are better at doing that thing that people that don't specialize in doing that thing".

#### Rules as Referee Tools

Those rules are for the referee to help them adjudicate the players' action: How to handle Reactions from NPCs, how to handle Morale, the standard difficulty for a PC skill check or save, etc.

#### Rules as Player Restrictions

This part of the rules is intended to put limits to what player can do, and also to set the tone of the kind of game the rules want to create.

##### How to handle carried gear and items

As finding treasure and carrying it back is central to this game, Inventory management is important. There are 3 things that goes into a PC's inventory over the course of the game:

1. **Equipment**: Tools, consumables and class specific items take up slots as you carry them during the adventure. Most items take 1 slot, some may be bundled to carry more than 1 per slot, and a few exception may take 2 or more slots. Worn equipment does not count in your inventory, except for metal armor (e.g. Chainmail and Platemail), for which it represents effort adventuring with donned armor.
   * Depletable and indispensable resources like food, water and light are part of your adventuring equipment, and you will need them in the wilderness.
2. **Treasure**: When you find treasure during an adventure, be it coins or precious items, they also fill slots in your inventory. This means that you need to balance your load between equipment you bring in, and treasure you bring back.
3. **Injuries**: Technically not items, but still counted in your inventory. This system does not have Hit Points, preferring instead to track injuries metaphorically filling your inventory to represent your PC getting worn out by adventuring and battle.

However, Inventory is limited: your PC's maximum inventory size is related to your Attributes, and only grows slowly over the course of your level ups. Some classes may increase the number of inventory slots for a specific kind of gear (e.g. the Specialist has more space, dedicated to tools and toolkits).

##### How to interact with the world

The rule of thumbs to know if a plan might work:

* If it is trivial, it usually just works
* If is is reasonable, the Referee may ask for a small cost (spent item, a small HP loss, etc.)
* If it is risky, the Referee should ask for a roll and/or a high cost (spent items and HP loss?)
* If it is farfetched, find another plan.

##### How to mechanically advance

PCs can advance in two ways:

1. **Diegetically**, by finding new gear, new allies, more knowledge: This is a mostly horizontal progression, widening the breadth of tools that the player can use, but it may also sometimes be vertical, by finding some specific magic items that grant more power (A sword that deals more vicious injuries, a cursed amulet that grants additional Magic Dice).
2. **Mechanically**, primarily by levelling up, granting more class features, more action dice: This progression is both vertical (you automatically get more Action Dice and increased Attributes) and horizontal (More class features facilitating the use of other rules: A bonus to reaction for your hirelings, a way to create new spells, more inventory space for your tools). Mechanical progress may also happen outside of levelling up for Magic Users, as they may find new spells while adventuring, thus increasing their magical palette of spells.

**Diegetic advancement** is the result of players interacting with the world, and this is mostly restricted by the other part of the rules (Reactions from NPCs, Encumbrance, Play Procedures, etc.). However, **mechanical advancement** is governed by a set of rules, that dictates how you gain XP, how much XP you need, what you need to do to gain that advancement (training with a master), as the benefits are more set in stone, and "guaranteed" by the ruleset.

##### How to handle injuries and death

### Procedures

Procedures are meant to both structure play at the table, and measure time spent diegetically. This ruleset explicitly describes 3 procedures framing players action: Combat, Dungeon Crawling and Wilderness Movement. Using procedures is automatic: If a player or the party wants to do an activity that fits one of the defined procedures, then the procedure is used. This

### Diegetic Expectations

#### The Scale of Power

PCs are competent humans, not superheroes. Moving a boulder may be done with either enough people, horsepower, or ingenious leverage using the surrounding environment, but moving a mountain is impossible within this ruleset. Magic may skew this a little (moving TWO boulders, imagine that?), but still isn't omnipotent.

#### Time

> YOU CAN NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.

There, everything is said.

...

Fine, maybe some clarifying is needed.

Every action of the PCs take time, and the PCs have a limited range of action they can take during a specific period. Combat rounds, Dungeon turns, Wilderness watches serve as both game turns, to structure how players can act, and as a measure of the passing of time: As a watch is 4h, you can only explore during 4 of the 6 watches of a day (you still need to rest and sleep the remaining 2); As a turn is 10min, you can only take 24 turns in a watch. Furthermore, the act of levelling up also takes time (2 week of forced downtime), recovering from injuries takes time (from a few days to several weeks), etc.

During this passing time, in which PCs act, the rest of the world still moves forwards: NPCs with plans advances them, Cleared dungeons get restocked, Factions interact with each other at a bigger scale.

All this means that ensuring that actions take time, and measuring this time purposefully, ground the game in verisimilitude that enhances the choices that players make, instead of the dissonant "hero to god in two months" form that modern fantasy games usually take.



## TO SORT

### How the Game restricts you, the PC

#### Mechanically

##### Play Structures

Play structures are both a tool and a restriction. They serve to frame and organize both play at the table, and PCs actions in the world.

##### The Inventory

The most important part of your character sheet is the **Inventory**:

* You want to bring something to the adventure, put it in your inventory;
* You want to take something back from the adventure, put it in your inventory;
* You get hurt while adventuring, put the injury in your inventory (not diegetically of course, but injuries are tracked in your inventory, and take the place of anything else you might be carrying).

However, your inventory size is limited by your Attributes, and if you carry more than your Attributes allows you, you will be severely penalized.

##### The Dice



#### Diegetically

This is more of a soft restriction, rather than a hard rule.
