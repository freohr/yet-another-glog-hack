## Attributes

PCs have six attributes: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**; Each is noted as a bonus on the Character Sheet.
Attributes are generated by rolling 3d6, assigning the lowest rolled die as the Attribute Bonus, in order. This means that starting Attributes Bonuses are between +1 and +6, tending towards lower values.

### Attributes Description

- __Strength__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, etc.
  - The bonus is added to melee attacks as a to-hit bonus.
  - A PC’s number of inventory slots is increased by the median of their Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence bonuses.
- __Dexterity__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes, like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
  - A PC’s number of inventory slots is increased by the median of their Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence bonuses.
- __Constitution__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves to resist poison, sickness, cold, harsh weather, etc.
  - A higher Constitution bonus reduces the gravity of injuries sustained.
- __Intelligence__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves requiring concentration and precision, such as wielding magic, resisting magical effects, recalling lore, crafting objects, tinkering with machinery, picking pockets, etc.
  - A PC’s number of inventory slots is increased by the median of their Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence bonuses.
- __Wisdom__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves requiring perception and intuition, such as tracking, navigating, searching for secret doors, detecting illusions, etc.
  - The bonus is added to ranged missile attacks as a to-hit bonus.
- __Charisma__:
  - Used for skill checks and saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, etc.
  - PCs may employ a number of hirelings equal to their Charisma bonus. A PC may have a lifetime number of henchpersons equal to 5 + their starting Charisma bonus; Write it down during character creation.
  - Used for Morale and Reaction rolls.

### Using Attributes

#### Making Skill checks

When attempting something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences, you make a skill check. To make a skill check, roll 2d10, then add the relevant ability bonus to the result, plus anything from skill die usage. If the total is greater than 15 (so >= 16), they succeed, if not, they fail.

- If you didn't use any tools for this skill check (e.g. breaking down a door with brute force)
  - On a Success: You get the intended result, but this took the whole turn.
  - On a Failure: Nothing happens, and this took the whole turn.
- If you used appropriate tools (e.g. forcing a door with a crowbar, or picking the lock):
  - On a Success: You get the intended result, and the rest of the party may act on what you achieved (if they didn't act this turn yet)
  - On a Failure: you get the intended result, but this took the whole turn

Note that, regardless of the roll result, making noise may attract unwanted company!

#### Making Saves

When trying to resist dangerous effects, you make a saving throw, or “save”. To make a save, add the bonus of the relevant ability to a d20 roll. If the total is greater than to 15 (so >= 16), your character resists. If not, they incur the full effect.

### Additional Characteristics

- __Armor__: Armor comes with an armor defense value. Note that value on your character sheet with its corresponding Armor bonus (always 10 less than the defense). If your PC is not wearing any armor, their armor defense is 11 and their armor bonus is +1.
- __Inventory__: PCs have a number of item slots equal to 10 + the median of their Dexterity, Strength and Intelligence bonuses; items they carry must fit into available slots.
  - Most items take up one slot, but some take up more. Small items can be bundled together into a single slot. Ask the referee if you are unsure.

## Template-based Classes

From level 1 onwards, during [level up](#leveling-up-training-with-the-masters), characters choose a class template to gain a few specialization bonus and tools. Characters cannot have more than 6 class templates in total.

Templates from different classes may be taken without restriction (mixing and matching is encouraged to customize and/or specialize your character), but they may only be taken in order, e.g. a "Fighter C" template may not be taken until the character has also taken the Fighter's "A" and "B" template, but a "Pyromancer A" template may be taken along a "Cat-burglar B" template.

Each class template grants specialized abilities, as well as one [Action Die](#action-dices) of a specific type, and unique ways to use them in play.

The Classes and Templates available selection should be tailored to the campaign run by the referee.

## Action Dices

All class templates give an action die, that may be spent during specific circumstances to improve the action being attempted. All action dices are d6. When a die is spent, the player rolls, even if the action attempted does not care about the resulting face, as the dices are retained when they roll a 1, 2 or 3.
Actions may care about the result of the dice roll in many different ways, here are a few examples:

- [dice]: the number of dice spent
- [sum]: the sum of the rolled values
- [highest]/[lowest]: the highest (resp. lowest) value rolled on a die

Action dices are recovered after a good night rest.

### Fighting Dices

Fighting dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for physical confrontation (as a fighter, an archer, a brawler, etc.).

#### Basic Fighting Die Usages

In addition to what the template grants, they may be spent as follow:

- Precision Strike: Before rolling the attack, grants +[dice] bonus to hit
- Power Attack: Before rolling the attack, trades -[dice] to attack for +[dice] additional wounds inflicted on hit.
- Shield Block: When begin attacked, you can raise your shield to brace for defense.
  - Choose one:
    - Before rolling for defense, increase AC by [highest],
    - After rolling for defense, increase AC by [dice].
  - This may be used to protect a close ally.

#### Combat Mishaps

If you roll doubles when attacking, roll on your class's mishap table. If you gained Fighting Dice from multiple classes, choose one before rolling.

### Skill Dices

Skill dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for non-combat, non-magic skills (as a thief, a tracker, a crafting specialist).

#### Basic Skill Die Usages

In addition to benefits granted by templates, skill dice may be spent as follow:

- When rolling for the skill, grants +[highest] to the result
- Once per procedure turn, after rolling for the skill, you may spend 1 die to re-roll without time penalty (i.e. try to act again in the same turn)

#### Skill Mishaps

If you roll doubles while using skills, roll on your class's mishap table. If you gained Skill Dice from multiple classes, choose one before rolling. You still obtain the result as rolled, but nicked tools and cuts happen even to the best.

### Magic Dices & Spellcasting

Magic dices are granted by templates that allows characters to practice magic without any external help. Their usage are governed by [template features](#template-based-classes) and spell-casting. See [the Magic Rules](magic/magic-rules.md) for more details.

### Notes

Legendary items and Artifacts may grant characters additional dices of the type appropriate for the items (Sentient swords may give Fighting dices, Eldritch Tomes may give Magic dices, Enchanted tools may give Skill dices, etc.).

## Advancement

### Why and How: "Treasure Value-for-XP", a.k.a. Earning XP by uncovering treasure

_For a more detailed explanation I agree with, see the "Location-Based Games" series at [Haughty Fantasy Adventures](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/): [Part 1](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-1-clarifying.html), [Part 2](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-2-textured.html) [Part 3](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-3-but-what.html)._

"Treasure Value-for-XP" (usually mentioned or noted as Gold-for-XP) is a advancement paradigm that encourages player-driven objectives and adventuring. The feedback loop is simple :

1. Adventuring rewards characters with liquid currency (in the form of silver/gold pieces, or treasure to be sold)
2. Players have currency to spent for personal goals
3. But this currency is finite, and/or Some goals are more costly than what the characters currently have
4. Players can go adventuring to get more currency
5. Go to 1., Adventuring rewards characters with currency, etc.

Furthermore, XP for Treasure value is only counted and awarded when the characters bring their hard-earned/ill-gotten treasure back to a know safe town. In this sense, leveling is akin to the growing reputation of the members of the party.

For this rule-set, XP is counted thus: **Each 1 Silver Piece of treasure brought to the safety of a civilized town counts as 1 XP for the whole group**, to be divided evenly between each player character that participated in the adventure. This is counted before the treasure itself is divided between characters and henchpersons.

### Leveling up: Training with the masters

To advance in level, your total XP must be above your next level threshold. When this happen, you may take the needed downtime to [find a master](#leveling-up-training-with-the-masters) to train you. After training is complete, you may choose 3 stats, add a +1 bonus to them (then adjust their Defense accordingly), then mark down your new Resilience maximum and you new XP threshold.

*Table X: Character Class Advancement*
| Level | XP Total Threshold | Max Resilience | Class Templates | Attribute Increases |
| :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: |
|   1   |         -          |     Con-4      |        1        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   2   |        1500        |     Con-2      |        2        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   3   |        4000        |      Con       |        3        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   4   |        8000        |     Con+2      |        4        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   5   |       15 000       |     Con+4      |        5        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   6   |       30 000       |     Con+6      |        6        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |

As XP abstracts adventuring prowess and reputation in the current campaign setting, leveling can be done when a character reach a certain threshold by finding an NPC of the class you, the player, want your character to take a template level in and asking them to train your character. Here are the specific rules for advancement:

- To be able to train for a specific class template, the party (not necessarily the character themselves) must know/have discovered an NPC or a faction that is a master of this class.
- Training for a new level takes two weeks of downtime, starting from a safe town, including travel to and from the town.
- Training cost silver equal to 10% of the target character level
  - For example, attaining level 2 requires a PC to find 1500s worth of treasure, then paying 150s and spending 2 weeks with a master for training.

After training, characters advance in level and obtain each benefit listed in the advancement table, just above, for the level they have attained.

### Leveling Up: Beyond Training

*Table X: Character Advancement, beyond classes*
| Level | Investment Threshold | Max Resilience | Class Templates | Attribute Increases |
| :---: | :------------------: | :------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: |
|   7   |        25 000        |     Con+7      |        -        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   8   |        50 000        |     Con+8      |        -        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|   9   |       100 000        |     Con+9      |        -        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|  10   |       200 000        |     Con+10     |        -        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |
|  +1   |       +200 000       |       +1       |        -        |  +1 for 3 bonuses   |

After reaching level 6 (and acquiring your last class template), training is not sufficient enough to continue advancing. In order to keep advancing, characters must invest in long-lasting projects (Strongholds, Magical Workings, etc.) in order to gain experience as reputation.

Furthermore, as you continue to level up, you gain titles to represent acknowledgment of your deed by the powerful of the civilized world. If you have a specific ancestry, you may choose their title list. If you have at least 3 templates in an Occupation, you may instead choose the column matching its theme for your title progression.

*Table X: High level Occupation Titles*
| Level |   Fighters   |  Magic Users  |   Cleric    |    Specialists    |     Thieves     |
| :---: | :----------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :---------------: | :-------------: |
|   7   |  Baron·ess   | Thaumaturgist |   Curate    |   Wrenchmaster    |   Cat Burglar   |
|   8   |  Count·ess   |    Warlock    |   Bishop    |  Chief Mechanic   | Master Pilferer |
|   9   |  Marquis·e   |    Wizard     |  Justiciar  | Engineer Emeritus |    Trickster    |
|  10+  | Duke/Duchess |   Archmage    | High Priest |   Guild Master    |  Master Thief   |

*Table X: High level Ancestry Titles*
| Level |    Humans    |   Dwarves   |   Halflings   |   Elves    |
| :---: | :----------: | :---------: | :-----------: | :--------: |
|   7   |  Baron·ess   |    Lord     | Village Elder |  Strider   |
|   8   |  Count·ess   |  Forgelord  |       -       |   Warden   |
|   9   |  Marquis·e   |    Thane    |       -       |            |
|  10+  | Duke/Duchess | Hammerthane |       -       | Pathfinder |

### Backup Experience

When gaining Experience, you may add an extra 20% of it to your **Backup Experience**, used to level up new characters after your current character either dies or retires.

Note: Even after reaching level 6, you still count 20% of the treasure brought to the safety of a town as **Backup Experience**.

## Injuries, Dismemberment and Death

### Incurring Injuries

Injuries are par for the course when adventuring, but it need not be a tragedy. The basics are:

- When you take a hit, roll on the Injury table below.
- You suffer the rolled injury, which takes out one of your inventory slots.
- Write your injuries starting from the end of your inventory.
- If the slot contained an item, you drop it at the moment you suffer the injury.
- If you suffer a **Major Injury**, you are out of the action

To roll on the **Injuries** table, roll `1d12 + the number of injuries you currently suffer from - your Constitution bonus`, then diegetically adjudicate the result to the current situation. Some effect may ask you to roll a **Minor Injury**, in this case, replace the d12 with a d6.

Injuries from 1 to 6 are considered **Minor Injuries**, they do not have lasting effects. Injuries, from 7 and higher, are **Major injuries**; PCs suffer both the immediate effect, and the lasting effect until the character get rest in a safe town.

*Table X: Injuries & Dismemberment*
| Die Roll |       Injury       | Immediate Effect                                                                                     | Until recovery                                                                                      |
| :------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1-2    |  Merely a scratch  | Definitely a scar however. Roll a d4, on a 1, it's located where you can hide it with your clothes   | Nothing, luckily                                                                                    |
|   3-4    |     Concussion     | You cannot use Action die for the rest of the day                                                    | Nothing, yet                                                                                        |
|   5-6    | Just a Flesh Wound | Can't use the injured part for the rest of the day                                                   | Nothing, but you came close                                                                         |
|    7     |   Lost extremity   | Roll d6 to find out what you lost: <br/>1. Fingers (d3); 2. Hand; 3. Nose; 4. Ear; 5. Eye; 6. Looks. | Disadvantage on tasks requiring that former extremity.                                              |
|    8     |    Leg Useless     | Pass out from the pain. You need an additional hour to regain consciousness                          | Can’t run. Disadvantage on agility tasks                                                            |
|    9     |    Arm Useless     | Pass out from the pain. You need an additional hour to regain consciousness                          | Disadvantage when needing both arms or if it was the dominant hand                                  |
|    10    |     Head wound     | Lose half your action dice.                                                                          | Disadvantage on all rolls                                                                           |
|    11    |     Lost Limb      | You can't stand on your own, needing help and support to move                                        | Same as useless leg or arm, but it won't regrow. Disadvantage becomes a permanent -2 after recovery |
|    12    |     Hemorrhage     | You are bleeding out, and need tending to in d4 turns or you will die exsanguine.                    | Your action dice count as 3 (for the total roll, not the keeping-it part) when rolled as 3+.        |
|   13+    |       Death        | Your luck has run out, and Death has come to take its toll                                           | You aren't expected to recover from this one...                                                     |

### Recovering from injuries

#### Natural Recovery

To recover from injuries, you need rest, plain and simple. For each injury, you need a number of days of rest equal to the roll value in the Injury Table; for **minor injuries**, take the lower value (1 day, 3 days and 5 days respectively).

After recovery, you regain the inventory slots incapacitated by injury.

You may choose to interrupt rest if you wish to go back adventuring before full recovery, but you only heal after each rest threshold (1 day for a simple scratch, 9 days for a disabled arm, etc.)

Note however, than any injury you suffer leaves a mark on your character. When you recover from an injury, add a line to your character description about the newly minted scar you received.

#### Magical Recovery

Magical healing is a godsend when dealing with adventuring injuries, still it is not omnipotent. When receiving magical healing, you can choose one:

- Either remove a **minor injury** completely (you can choose to get a scar or not),
- Or ignore the lasting effect of a **major injury**, but it still takes an inventory slot.

### A new Path

Now, loosing a character does not means the end of it all: If you are adventuring which henchpeoples (either one of your character's, or one of a fellow character's), you are allowed to "promote" one of them, and adopt them as your new PC. If you prefer to create another PC, say so to the Referee, roll another one using the rules in [Character Discovery](CharacterCreation.md). After choosing which character to play, you may use any [backup Experience](#backup-experience) to level them up, up to half your previous PC level, on the spot if you wish to (you may also restart from level 1 if you prefer).
