# Alternate Rules

But really, rules to be put in the final ruleset, but not yet finished

## Bonus-only attributes

Remove the mentions of defenses, explicitly define derived stats:

* Inventory is: 10 + Middle of STR/DEX/INT
* Lifetime Henchfolks is 5 + Starting CHA
* AC Bonus is depending on armor
* Attacking is d20 + STR for melee >= Opponent AC, d20 + WIS for ranged >= Opponent AC
* Defending is d20 + AC >= Opponent Attack Value
  * Note for both: All rolls are advantageous for the players, which means that if the roll equals the target value, it is successful

## Remove Clerics, replace by White Magic

Add schools of magic for White Magic (Light, Radiant, Healing), No dedicated Cleric class until someone is accepted by the local Church.

## Injury-based Survival

1. No more HP, HP-Like mechanic, Health, Resilience, or whatever
2. When you take damage, instead you roll on the dismemberment table, which means that you receive an injury each time you take damage
   1. Taking damage means either :
      1. weapon attack roll higher than your AC
      2. a damaging spell effect
      3. a failed save against an dangerous environment effect
      4. the referee saying you take damage
   2. You are not automatically out of combat on an injury, only for major injuries (7+)
3. Constitution is subtracted from the injury roll, so more CON equals less serious injuries.
   1. Now, the injury roll is `d12 + # of injuries - CON`
4. Injuries still take an Inventory slot, so more injuries equal a worse ability to carry equipment and treasure.
5. Monsters may have up to their HD count injuries, or HD mod 5 major injuries (0-4: max 1 major, 5-9: max 2 majors, etc.). Roll d12 when a player inflict damage to define which injury is inflicted. When a player attacks to subdue, roll 2d12, keeping the lowest roll.

### Other rules impacted by this

1. Combat : Overloaded Initiative Die
   1. The "Fatigue!" result instead says "All combattant in melee have -1 AC until the next turn"
2. Equipment: Weapons
   1. Simple weapons are 1 injury, Martial weapons (longsword, greataxe, flamberge, warhammer) roll 2d12 keep highest for the injury.
   2. Shields: May be splintered before the injury roll to negate an injury
3. Twenty System Questions:
   * 2/ How are Death and Dying handled?
     * Replace with: "Damage means you roll on the Injury Table, more injuries mean higher rolls, higher rolls mean worse results for your PC, with Death at the highest result of 13+. Some results may require immediate attention or lead to Death otherwise.
   * 7/ Do I get any benefits for wearing a helmet?
      * Replace benefit for Dwarf as "Helmets can be splintered to negate an injury, before the injury roll"
4. Classes
    * Elves
      * Fey Ancestry:
        * Replace "Iron Bane" with "whenever you touch iron, roll an injury, replacing the d12 with with d4 + [templates]"
        * Replace "Oath Bound" with "You cannot lie, and whenever someone breaks their word with you, they roll an injury"
    *
