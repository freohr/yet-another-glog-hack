# Player and GM Agenda

## GM Agenda: The Principia Apocrypha

If this is your first time playing an OSR game, Read (or at least skim through) the Principia Apocrypha (even as a player).

This document highlights Player and Referee Agendas for an old-school style of play in a few pages: [Get it here](docs/Principia-Apocrypha-Booklet-12o.pdf), [original link with other reflections on the why and how of the OSR](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html).

## Player Agenda: Aphorisms

Those agendas can also be said as those 10 aphorisms ([from a now defunct G+ thread](https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/LinksToWisdom/What_are_assumptions_about_how_to_play_an_OSR_adventure_that_you_think_might_not_be_commonly_held_as_desired%3F)) (+ an important one from the global community), with my commentary on it:

0. You are not a hero.
   1. You can become one, but it's on you.
1. This is a game about interacting with this world as if it were a place that exists.
2. There is nothing that is “supposed” to happen.
    * The adventure does not come to you, you go to it.
3. Killing things is not the goal.
    * Killing is only a mean to an end, there are many other means, and many other ends.
4. Unknowability and consequence make everything interesting.
    * This is not chess. Failure is part of the game: Dealing with it creates the story.
5. You play as your character, not as the screenwriter writing your character.
    * The story is not the goal, it is what happened at the table.
6. It’s your job to make your character interesting and to make the game interesting for you.
    * Be proactive, Create your own goals.
7. If you find yourself in a fair fight, your tactics suck.
    * The rules and the referee are not here to advantage you, they are neutral arbiters. Create your own advantage.
    * Regarding Combat: Combat is a tool, but it is a blade without a handle. It can be very powerful when correctly controlled, but will cut deep if gone out of hand.
8. The answer is not on your character sheet.
    * Your sheet may give you tools, but solutions can only come from you.
9. Things are swingy.
10. You will die.
    * No safety net in the rules, if you want one, make one.
