# Referee Rules

This document is available to players for information and fairness, but it only contains rules used by the referee to adjudicate PCs actions.

## NPCs Reaction

### Encounter Reaction

During first contact between the PC party and a NPC group, or whenever the referee wish to determine an NPC reaction, roll 2d10, adjust with any relevant modifier (adding to the roll makes the NPCs more hostile, subtracting makes them friendlier, so ask the players their intention), then consult the table below to find out the NPC reaction.

Look at the column corresponding to the party behavior, look at the line with the result on the roll, and the reaction is on the right.

#### Table X : Reaction Roll Results

| Friendly | Indifferent | Threatening | Hostile |  Response   |
| :------: | :---------: | :---------: | :-----: | :---------: |
|    -     |      -      |      -      |   2-5   |   Flight    |
|   2-7    |     2-6     |     2-3     |    -    |  Friendly   |
|   8-11   |    7-11     |      -      |    -    | Indifferent |
|  12-15   |    12-14    |     4-9     |   6-8   |  Cautious   |
|  16-18   |    15-19    |    10-15    |  9-12   | Threatening |
|  19-20   |    19-20    |    16-20    |  13-20  |   Hostile   |

### Morale

When exposed to danger (be it environmental or during combat), NPCs may crack under pressure. In such situations
, the referee may check for Morale to find out if those NPCs stay in the action or try to run away.

To check for Morale, roll 2d10, adjust with any relevant modifier, then compare the result to the NPC morale score. If the roll is higher, the NPC try its hardest to flee or escape. Otherwise, they remain in the action.

#### Table X: General Situations to check for Morale

* 25% of group has fallen
* 50% of group has fallen
* Each companion that dies after 50% of the group has fallen
* Leader of a group deserts or falls
* Fighting creatures that cannot be harmed due to magical protections
* First round after being surprised
* Faced with a vastly superior force
* Ally is slain by magic
* Ordered to attempt a suicidal task
* Offered a bribe or tempting but dangerous request (§1)
* Ordered to cover a withdrawal or act as rearguard
* Ordered to use a charge from a personal, powerful magic item (§1)
* Offered a chance to surrender (assuming one or more of the other morale conditions is in effect)
* Surrounded or completely overwhelmed

> §1: Check Morale to see if the NPC accepts or refuses.
