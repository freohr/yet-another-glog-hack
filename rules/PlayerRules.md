# Player Rules

## Attributes

## Template-based Classes

## Action Dices

All class templates give an action die, that may be spent during specific circumstances to improve the action being attempted. All action dices are d6. When a die is spent, the player rolls, even if the action attempted does not care about the resulting face, as the dices are retained when they roll a 1, 2 or 3.
Actions may care about the result of the dice roll in many different ways, here are a few examples:

* [count]: the number of dice spent
* [sum]: the sum of the rolled values
* [highest]/[lowest]: the highest (resp. lowest) value rolled on a die

Action dices are recovered after a good night rest.

### Fighting Dices

Fighting dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for physical confrontation (as a fighter, an archer, a brawler, etc.). In addition to what the template grants, they may be spent as follow:

* Precision Strike: Before rolling the attack, grants +[count] bonus to hit
* Power Attack: Before rolling the attack, trades -[count] to attack for +[sum] bonus to damage
* While using a shield, reduces incoming damage by [sum]. This may be used to reduce damage for a close ally.

### Skill Dices

Skill dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for non-combat, non-magic skills (as a thief, a tracker, a crafter). In addition to benefits granted by templates, skill dice may be spent as follow:

* Before rolling for the skill, grants +[highest] to the result
* Once per procedure turn, after rolling for the skill, you may spend 1 die to reroll without time penalty (i.e. try to act again in the same turn)

### Magic Dices

Magic dices are granted by templates that allows characters to practice magic without any external help.

### Notes

Legendary items and Artifacts may grant characters additional dices of the type appropriate for the items (Sentient swords may give Fighting dices, Eldritch Tomes may give Magic dices, Enchanted tools may give Skill dices, etc.)

## Advancement

### Why and How: Treasure Value-for-XP, a.k.a. Earning XP by uncovering treasure

_For a more detailed explanation I agree with, see the "Location-Based Games" series at [Haugthy Fantasy Adventures](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/): [Part 1](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-1-clarifying.html), [Part 2](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-2-textured.html) [Part 3](http://haughtyfantasy.blogspot.com/2021/02/location-based-games-part-3-but-what.html)._

Treasure Value-for-XP (usually mentionned as Gold-for-XP) is a advancement paradigm that encourages player-driven objectives and adventuring. The feedback loop is simple : 

1. Adventuring rewards characters with liquid currency (in the form of silver/gold pieces, or treasure to be sold)
2. Players have currency to spent for personal goals
3. But this currency is finite, and/or Some goals are more costly than what the characters currently have
4. Players can go adventuring to get more currency
1. Go to 1., Adventuring rewards with currency, etc.

Furthermore, XP for Treasure value is only counted and awarded when the characters bring their hard-earned/ill-gotten treasure back to a know safe town. In this sense, leveling is akin to the growing reputation of the members of the party.

For this ruleset, XP is counted thusly: **Each 1 Silver Piece of treasure brought to the safety of a civilized town counts as 1 XP for the whole group**, to be divided evenly between each player character that participated in the adventure. This is counted before the treasure itself is divided between characters and retainers/hirelings/henchpeople.

### Leveling up: Training with the masters

As XP abstracts reputation in the current campaign setting, leveling can be done when a character reach a certain treshold by finding an NPC of the class you, the player, want your character to take a template level in and asking them to train your character. Here are the specific rules for advancement:

* To be able to train for a template, the party (not necessarily the specific character) must know/have discovered an NPC or a faction that is a master of this class.
* Training for a new level takes two weeks of downtime, starting from a safe town, including travel to and from the town.
* Training cost gold equal to 10% of the target character level (e.g. going from lvl 1 to lvl 2 cost 10% of the lvl 2 XP threshold)
