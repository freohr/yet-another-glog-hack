# Player Rules

## Attributes

## Action Dices

All class templates give an action die, that may be spent during specific circumstances to improve the action being attempted. All action dices are d6. When a die is spent, the player rolls, even if the action attempted does not care about the resulting face, as the dices are retained when they roll a 1, 2 or 3.
Actions may care about the result of the dice roll in many different ways, here are a few examples:

* [count]: the number of dice spent
* [sum]: the sum of the rolled values
* [highest]/[lowest]: the highest (resp. lowest) value rolled on a die

Action dices are recovered after a good night rest.

### Fighting Dices

Fighting dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for physical confrontation (as a fighter, an archer, a brawler, etc.). In addition to what the template grants, they may be spent as follow:

* Precision Strike: Before rolling the attack, grants +[count] bonus to hit
* Power Attack: Before rolling the attack, trades -[count] to attack for +[sum] bonus to damage
* While using a shield, reduces incoming damage by [sum]. This may be used to reduce damage for a close ally.

### Skill Dices

Skill dices are granted by templates that enhance a character ability for non-combat, non-magic skills (as a thief, a tracker, a crafter). In addition to benefits granted by templates, skill dice may be spent as follow:

* Before rolling for the skill, grants +[highest] to the result
* Once per procedure turn, after rolling for the skill, you may spend 1 die to reroll without time penalty (i.e. try to act again in the same turn)

### Magic Dices

Magic dices are granted by templates that allows characters to practice magic without any external help.
