## Introduction

In this document are various unsorted rules and tools that players may use to help them while adventuring.

## Cost of living

Day-to-day expenses are aggregated in a weekly paid cost-of-living. Those expenses must be paid weekly, and provides various benefits and drawbacks depending on what you choose to pay for.

## Equipment

Good equipment is the lifeline of any respectable adventurer.

### Inventory & Resources

Inventory management is the backbone of sandbox play, and must be followed.

#### Inventory

In order to facilitate this aspect of play, PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Constitution defense, and items they carry must fit into available slots. Most items take up one slot, but some take up more. Some small items can be bundled together into a single slot. Ask the referee if you are unsure.

#### The Resource Die

Some resources are tracked with a Resource Die, instead of an explicit count. The Resource Die is single die, on the die chain from `d12` to `d4` : `d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4`. To track usage for such a resource, after each significant use, roll the usage die: on a 1, reduce the dice one step on the dice chain. When rolling a 1 on a d4 usage die, the resource runs out.

#### Resources

There are 4 kinds of depletable resources: Food, Water, Light and Arrows.

- Food: Rations come either as Standard or Dried packages. Either kind can fit 5 days worth of it (for 1 person) in 1 inventory slot, however Standard rations will spoil in a week, whereas Dried rations spoil in a month
- Water: Like food, water is necessary for survival. You can fit 5 days of water for 1 person in 1 inventory slot.
- Light
  - Torches: Torches burn for about 6 turns (1hr), you can fit 5 of them in 1 inventory slot
  - Lantern and Oil: A unit of oil burns for about 18 turns (3hrs), but you need a lantern to use it as a source of light. 5 units of oil take 1 inventory slot, and a lantern takes another by itself.
- Arrows and Bolts
  - Ammunition for ranged weapons is handled with a Resource Die. A `d12` takes 3 slots, a `d10` takes 2 slots, and `d8` and lower take 1 inventory slot.

Currency also takes space in your inventory: Each 200 coins take 1 inventory slot.

### Standard Equipment

Standard equipment may be bought in town in reasonable quantities (buying 20m/60ft of rope every few days of adventuring is fine, buying 1km of it at once is not).

#### Durability

Most equipment has 3 durability points. Rough use may damage the item, removing durability points. When an item has no durability remaining, it is broken beyond repair.Regaining durability requires repairs, take 10% of the item cost for each missing durability point.

#### Weapons

#### Armors

#### Adventuring Gear

### Magic Items

Magic items cannot be bought, they can only be found (usually in treasure troves), received (as a reward, a gift or a bribe) or created (taking up precious time and resources). They are indestructible, barring some specific ritual designed to destroy them.

## Henchfolks and Hirelings

There is a distinction between a Henchfolk and a Hireling. Hireling are simply followers, paid to do a specific job for the character of the party, while Henchfolk are lifelong companions, with their own goals and motivations.

### Henchfolks

As noted, Henchfolk are actually lifelong companions, and as such, a PC has a lifetime henchfolk limit of half its starting Charisma defense (rounded down), which need to be noted down during character creation. During adventures, each PC may only be accompanied by 1 henchfolk, but they can change which companion they wish to adventure with while in a safe town (most likely in a town where that companion is currently residing).

Henchfolks are NPCs with class templates, or at least a general archetype (Fighter, Magic User, etc.), but are limited in level to half the current level of the PC they're related to. They are willing to risk their lives to protect their PC companion, but are not single minded, and may still make Morale check if the situation proves dire.

When a PC dies, the player may freely opt to "promote" a current henchfolk as their new PC, and continue adventuring to avenge, mourn or pursue the legacy of their fallen comrade (or previous character at least). When this happen, the referee gives the player a character sheet (which may be a simplified PC sheet), for the remainder of the adventure, and as the adventure is concluded, the player may spend the same downtime as a level up to "retrain", or reorganize, their new PC class templates to suit their needs or wants.

As a suggestion to players, do not hesitate to listen to your companions tales, as their requests may provide a good source of adventure, and even open new opportunities. Who knows what can happen if the castaway daughter of a baron inherits her father's position?

### Hirelings

Hirelings, in contrast, are people salaried to do a specific job for the PC or party, who will not endanger their lives for treasure they will not see the color of.

Their characteristics are abstracted by a single die, along the dice chain `d4 > d6 > d8 > d10`, which represents their level, aptitude, and wage to be paid.
