## Introduction

Extracting Wealth from the dungeon, then spending it in town is the heart of this style of game: both a powerful motivation to go adventuring, and a powerful tool to influence the campaign setting.

In this document are described various rules and structures designed to frame how adventurers can spend their wealth.

## Cost of living

Day-to-day expenses are aggregated in a cost-of-living. Those expenses must be paid weekly, and provides various benefits and drawbacks depending on what you choose to pay for.

## Equipment

Good equipment is the lifeline of any respectable adventurer.

### Inventory & Resources

Inventory management is the backbone of sandbox play, and must be strictly followed.

#### Inventory

In order to facilitate this aspect of play, PCs have a number of item slots equal to "10 plus the median of their Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence attributes" (to model how much weight you can carry and/or how well can you organize it), and items they carry must fit into available slots. Most items take up one slot, but some take up more. Some small items can be bundled together into a single slot. Ask the referee if you are unsure.
Note that a PC is always assumed to have the necessary packs and containers to carry their inventory, that those containers do not take inventory space if they carry gear, and that specifics about what goes in which pack only matters when the fiction demands it (e.g. a dropped bag when trying to jump over a chasm).

#### The Resource Die

Some resources are tracked with a Resource Die, noted as `UdX`, instead of an explicit count. The Resource Die is single die, on the die chain from `d12` to `d4` : `Ud12 -> Ud10 -> Ud8 -> Ud6 -> Ud4`.

To track usage for such a resource, after each significant use, roll the usage die: on a 1 or a 2, reduce the dice one step on the dice chain. When rolling those values on a `Ud4` usage die, the resource runs out.

In your inventory, the higher the resource die, the more space the resource take: A `Ud12` takes 3 slots, a `Ud10` takes 2 slots, and `Ud8` and lower dice take 1 inventory slot.

To increase a resource die, you need to buy or find a quantity equal to the current resource die value you are carrying (e.g. if you have `Ud6` arrows, and find or buy another `Ud6` of arrows, mark down `Ud8` instead of `Ud6` twice). If you find resources with a lower quantity than you have, you can instead mark down a free advantage roll for the next time you use the resource (if you have `Ud8` arrows, and find `Ud4` arrows, write a mark next to it in your inventory, the next time you fire with your bow, roll 2d8 and use the highest result)

#### Resources

There are 4 kinds of depletable resources: Food, Water, Light and Arrows.

- **Food**: Rations come either as Standard or Dried packages. Either kind can fit 5 days worth of food (for 1 person) in 1 inventory slot. Standard rations will spoil in a week, whereas Dried rations spoil in a month.
- **Water**: Like food, water is necessary for survival. You can fit 5 days of water for 1 person in 1 inventory slot.
- **Light**
  - Torches: Torches burn for about 4 turns (40min), you can fit 5 of them in 1 inventory slot
  - Lantern and Oil: A unit of oil burns for about 12 turns (2hrs), but you need a lantern to use it as a source of light. 5 units of oil take 1 inventory slot, and a lantern takes another by itself.
- **Arrows and Bolts**
  - Ammunition for ranged weapons is handled with a [Resource Die](#the-resource-die). At the end of a turn during which you used a bow, crossbow, sling, etc., roll the resource die to check how ou recover your ammunition (Yes, this means only once after each battle, and once when using a bow to try and knock down a statuette to trigger a trap)

Currency also takes space in your inventory: Each 200 coins (of any kind) take 1 inventory slot.

### Standard Equipment

Standard equipment may be bought in town in reasonable quantities (buying 20m/60ft of rope every few days of adventuring is fine, buying 1km/512ft of it at once is not).

#### Durability

Most equipment has 3 durability points. Rough use may damage the item, removing durability points. When an item has no durability remaining, it is broken beyond repair. Regaining durability requires repairs, take 10% of the item cost and a day of work (for self-repair, takes less time if done by a specialized artisan) for each missing durability point.

#### Weapons

TODO: Define how weapons inflict Injuries

Weapons are sorted in 3 categories: Simple, Martial and Heavy. Those categories of weapons only dictates what kind of injuries they inflict, as mundane weapons do not grant any additional hit bonus.

- **Simple weapons**: Easy to conceal or to pass as something else: a dagger passing as a hunting knife, a walking staff used for striking. Fill 1 inventory slot when carried in inventory. This kind of weapons may be used as tools without degrading them (when using them in the appropriate circumstances).
- **Martial weapons**: Standard weapons, recognized as such by anyone: a bow, a sword, a mace. Melee weapons of this type may be used with 2 hands to add +1 to the damage roll, but prevents the use of a shield when wielded that way. Fill 1 inventory slot when carried in inventory.
- **Heavy weapons**: Massive, heavy weapons: a greataxe, a warhammer, a glaive-guisarme. Must be used with 2 hands (preventing the use of a shield), Fill 2 inventory slots when carried in inventory, still fills 1 inventory slot when worn and readied.

Martial and Heavy weapons may be used as improvised tools, but they incur a high risk of being degraded in the process (1-in-2 to lose durability when used that way).

Weapons of a standard make usually cost a few gold pieces. If you ever find magic weapons granting a +X bonus, you add the bonus to the attack roll (yes, it is intended that this makes it easier to inflict *Major Injuries*).

#### Armors

TODO: Define how armor prevents/reduces injuries

Armor is used for a PC's defensive roll, when attacked. There are 4 major groups of armor (plus clothes), granting incremental bonus to defense, and increasing encumbrance when worn:

| Armor               | Defense | Encumbrance (when worn) | Rough Cost                      |
| :------------------ | :-----: | :---------------------: | :------------------------------ |
| Unarmored (Clothes) |   +0    |            0            | a few coppers to hundreds of gp |
| Padded              |   +2    |            1            | 5 to 10 gp                      |
| Chain-mail          |   +4    |            2            | 80 to 100 gp                    |
| Half-plate          |   +6    |            3            | 400 to 500 gp                   |
| Full Plate          |   +8    |            4            | 1000 to 1500 gp                 |
| Shield              |   +1    |            1            | 5 to 10 gp                      |

This is the baseline for mundane armor. Enchanted armor may grant a higher defense bonus, or reduced encumbrance when worn. Shields may also be used to increase AC, but only when using a one handed weapon (meaning a **simple** or **martial** weapon)

Note that there is no innate defense bonus for PCs: If you want to avoid getting hit, either avoid combat, or wear armor.

#### Adventuring Gear

### Magic Items

Magic items cannot be bought, they can only be found (usually in treasure troves), received (as a reward, a gift or a bribe) or created (taking up precious time and resources). Those items tend to have distinct, extraordinary features, in addition to being indestructible by normal means.

## Henchfolks and Hirelings

There is a distinction between a Henchfolk and a Hireling. Hireling are simply followers, paid to do a specific job for the character of the party, while Henchfolk are lifelong companions, with their own goals and motivations.

### Henchfolks

As noted, Henchfolk are actually lifelong companions, and as such, a PC has a lifetime henchfolk limit of half its starting Charisma defense (rounded down), which need to be noted down during character creation. During adventures, each PC may only be accompanied by 1 henchfolk, but they can change which companion they wish to adventure with while in a safe town (most likely in a town where that companion is currently residing).

Henchfolks are NPCs with class templates, or at least a general archetype (Fighter, Magic User, etc.), but are limited in level to half the current level of the PC they're related to. They are willing to risk their lives to protect their PC companion, but are not single minded, and may still make Morale check if the situation proves dire.

When a PC dies, the player may freely opt to "promote" a current henchfolk as their new PC, and continue adventuring to avenge, mourn or pursue the legacy of their fallen comrade (or previous character at least). When this happen, the referee gives the player a character sheet (which may be a simplified PC sheet), for the remainder of the adventure, and as the adventure is concluded, the player may spend the same downtime as a level up to "retrain", or reorganize, their new PC class templates to suit their needs or wants.

As a suggestion to players, do not hesitate to listen to your companions tales, as their requests may provide a good source of adventure, and even open new opportunities. Who knows what can happen if the castaway daughter of a baron inherits her father's position?

### Hirelings

Hirelings, in contrast, are people salaried to do a specific job for the PC or party, who will not endanger their lives for treasure they will merely see the metallic glint of.

Their characteristics are abstracted by a single die, noted as `HdX`, along the dice chain `Hd4 > Hd6 > Hd8 > Hd10`, which represents their level, aptitude, and wage to be paid.

| Hireling Level |  Die  | Inventory | Wage / week |
| :------------: | :---: | :-------: | :---------: |
|       1        |  d4   |     4     |     1gp     |
|       2        |  d6   |     6     |     2gp     |
|       3        |  d8   |     8     |     5gp     |
|       4        |  d10  |    10     |    10gp     |

Some hirelings may have a specialty, and thus require a 50% higher wage. Some example of specialty include:

- Pack Bearer: Has twice the inventory slots
- Mercenary: Can fight alongside you
- Guide: Has knowledge of a specific region: cannot get lost in this region, has +2dX instead of tracking and orientation skill checks
- Mage: Has `lvl` random spells, uses its die as MD (yes, a single MD per day). May have a specialty school  if wage is doubled.
