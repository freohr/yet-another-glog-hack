## The Passage of Time

*"YOU CAN NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT."*

Doing anything takes time, which makes time the most precious resource of all. Game Play in this OSR Game is based around time and resources management, and this is represented by turn-based procedures for combat, dungeon and wilderness exploration, and eventually domain management. Resource management is represented as a number of turns between which players must spend those resources (food, water, light, etc.) or face varying penalties to their group during exploration.

| Turn                              | Base Turn Duration |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------: |
| Combat Round                      |     10 seconds     |
| Dungeon Turn                      |       10 min       |
| Wilderness Watch (1 Travel Point) |      4 hours       |
| Downtime                          |       1 day        |
| Haven/Domain Turn / Faction Turn  |      1 month       |

## Overloaded Encounter Die

_Original Idea from Necropraxis : [Overloading the encounter die](http://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/), and various refinements from around the OSR online communities_

To simplify time accounting, this game replace and merges the random encounter roll and fixed duration for each resource with an overloaded encounter die, rolled at the start of each turn, which will determine what initial situation the players need to handle before continuing their voyage. Here is the basic of this overloaded die:

*Table X: Overloaded Encounter Die template*

| Roll  | Event              | Precision                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---: | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | Encounter          | The Referee rolls a random encounter appropriate for the current milieu.                                                                                            |
|   2   | Environment Effect | The Referee rolls an environment effect appropriate for the current milieu (Omen of the next encounter in a dungeon, Change of weather in the wild or at sea, etc.) |
|   3   | Forced Rest        | The players must take the current turn to rest and consume food and water.                                                                                          |
|   4   | Waning Resources   | The players must reignite their light source (either a new torch, or another dose of oil), and Spell Effects end.                                                   |
|   5   | Free Turn          | Nothing specific happens, the players can simply continue their exploration unhindered.                                                                             |
|   6   | Good Encounter     | The Referee rolls a good random encounter appropriate for the current milieu (Helpful NPC, Secured Location, Resources are found, etc.).                            |

## Combat

### Turn Structure

Combat is acted out in rounds, with each round being resolved with the following structure:

1. The Overloaded Initiative Die is rolled
2. The result is adjusted by the referee to the current turn situation
3. Spellcasters announce if they are casting a spell
4. Parties that do not have initiative announce their actions for the turn
5. The party with initiative announce their actions for the turn; They can take into account what the other participants have announced.
6. Each participant actions are resolved.

### Overloaded Initiative Die

In lieu of rolling for initiative, the Overloaded Initiative Die will influence the site of battle itself and the ebb and flow of combat.

| Roll  | What Happens?                  | Details                                                                 | Who has initiative?       |
| :---: | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
|   1   | Noise has attracted something! | Roll for a random encounter, PCs can influence the Reaction roll.       | Opponents have Initiative |
|   2   | Fatigue!                       | Anyone currently in melee takes 1 damage.                               | Opponents have Initiative |
|   3   | The Dungeon reacts!            | An environmental effect disturbs the battle.                            | Opponents have Initiative |
|   4   | The Dungeon reacts!            | An environmental effect disturbs the battle.                            | PCs have Initiative       |
|   5   | A bit of respite...            | Nothing in particular happens                                           | PCs have Initiative       |
|   6   | Second Wind!                   | Any check the PCs make has a +1 (including magic, which is +1 to [sum]) | PCs have Initiative       |

### Having Initiative

In a combat turn, everything happens at once. However, having initiative means that you can try to influence what will be happening.

When you have initiative, your party is the last to announce its actions for the turn, and can take advantage of what the other parties have announced.

When resolving actions that are opposed/incompatible (e.g. The fighter tries to tackle the Orc, while the Orc wanted to move to attack the Magic User), make an opposed save. The winner of this save gets to act first. **Note**: When two participants are attacking either each other or the same target, this is not an opposed action: Resolve both attacks, then check who is still standing.

### Acting in combat

To act in a combat round, actors may choose one of the following:

- They can cast a spell, but they have to announce this before everyone else,
- They can do 4 different non-magical things (e.g. "I take oil from my pouch and I throw it at the lizardmen and I throw the torch in my hand in the puddle and I cower behind the Fighter"),
- They can do one non-magical thing twice (e.g. "I attack the kobold twice with my dagger", or "I shove a goblin to the ground, and another against the wall")

Some actions may be riskier than other, in which case the referee will ask for an appropriate roll to resolve it:

- To make an attack, roll d20+STR when in melee, d20+WIS when at range, if you roll higher than your target's AC, you hit.
- To use magic, roll the number of magic dice you wish, then apply the effect of the spell
- To roll an opposed check, roll d20 + the relevant stat, if you roll higher than your target's relevant attribute defense, you succeed.

## Dungeon Crawling

Dungeons (as the concept of a closed-off adventure site) are the main sites that players will interact with during play.

### Overloaded Dungeon Die

| Roll  | Event                   | Precisions                                     |
| :---: | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | An Encounter!           | The referee rolls for an appropriate encounter |
|   2   | The Dungeon rouses!     |
|   3   | Waning Resources        |
|   4   | Forced Rest             |
|   5   | The Dungeon slumbers... | Nothing special happens.                       |
|   6   | Good Encounter          |

### Dungeon Movement

### Dungeon Encounters

## Wilderness Travel and Hex-ploration

### Wilderness Movement

_Original Idea from OSR Simulacrum : [Making Wilderness Play Meaningful - A System](http://osrsimulacrum.blogspot.com/2020/05/making-wilderness-play-meaningful-system.html)_

Traveling and Exploration are both means to go adventuring and adventuring by themselves. As the wilderness is a dangerous place (regardless of settings, this rules- and procedures-set assumes a "Points-Of-Light" milieu), movement in the wilderness should not be abstracted as "Ok, 5 days later, you arrive at [...]". Furthermore, the main difference between travel and exploration is simply the knowledge of the destination (you can travel TO somewhere specific, but you only explore the uncharted). Sites and Point of Interests discovered during Exploration may be afterwards used as destination for Travel, as long as players (and characters) remember where those have been discovered.

Actual movement, beyond the number of hex that the party can travel through per day, and position inside an hex are abstracted when playing in this context. Furthermore, the party is always considered in an hex, until they finalize their movement, then they are in the targeted hex.

Now, for the actual movement rules:

- The party has a number of travel point dependent on the milieu of travel.  __For land travel__, they have 4 points of travel per day.
- Moving into an hex is represented by 1 point of movement. In standard condition, the party may spent 1 point of travel to move into a new hex. This means that, by default, 1 point of travel is equivalent to 1 point of movement.
- The party composition and means of travel may allow 1 point of travel to represent more than 1 point of movement (i.e. Movement is easier, so the party travels further than usual), or may requires more than 1 point of travel to move into a new hex (i.e. Movement is harder, the party cannot travel as far as usual)
- Terrain and Weather may increase or decrease the cost of moving into a new hex (similar to the rules of party composition)
- The party cannot overspend travel point to move into an hex, but they may "start" movement with points remaining at the end of the day, which will then count for their first movement of the next day (e.g. Moving with 5 points of travel one day, then 3 the next is not allowed, but moving with 3 points one day, then moving with 3 and 2 points the next day is okay).
- The party cannot move more than twice the maximum amount of travel point they have, i.e. with 4 travel points, they cannot move more than 8 movement points.
- If moving into an hex would cost twice or more the maximum amount of travel point the party has, the hex is considered impassable and the party cannot enter it (unless they change their travel condition)

Here are also multipliers for the more common travel conditions. Apply each that matches the party current travel arrangements. Note that those are multiplicative, e.g. if the party has a mount for everyone, but they are escorting a carriage, each travel point will allow them to move for `1 * 2 * 1/2 = 1` movement point, or 1 hex.

*Table X: Land Travel Accommodation*

| Accommodation                                                  | Movement Multiplier |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------: |
| The party is traveling by foot                                 |         x1          |
| All members of the party have a mount suitable for the terrain |         x2          |
| The party has a carriage                                       |        x1/2         |
| The party has more than 20 people                              |        x1/2         |
| The party has more than 50 people                              |        x1/2         |

*Table X: Land Travel Environment*

| Environment                          | Movement Multiplier |
| :----------------------------------- | :-----------------: |
| Traveling through plains             |         x1          |
| Traveling through hills              |        x2/3         |
| Traveling through marshes and swamps |        x1/2         |
| Traveling through forests and woods  |        x1/2         |
| Traveling through mountains          |        x1/4         |
| Traveling through high mountains     |   x0 (Impassable)   |
| There is a well maintained road      |         x2          |
| There is downtrodden road or a trail |        x1.5         |
| During rains                         |        x1/2         |
| During light snowfall                |        x1/2         |
| During heavy snowfall                |        x1/4         |

_**ToDo**: Define Travel points and Movement Multipliers for Water/Sea and Air travel._

#### Getting lost

_**ToDo**: Adapt "Getting Lost" rules from AD&D DMG_

Players should have access to a map of the region, but they should handle on their own

### Encounters

While travel or exploring, the Overloaded Encounter Die is used to simulate events outside the control of the players and characters.

- While **traveling**, this encounter die is rolled after the party has spent half of its travel point, and during the night camp.
- While **exploring**, this die is rolled after the party has spent its first travel point, after the party has spent all its travel point, and during the night camp.

This table should be adapted to the current party condition, e.g. if the party is traveling through a desert, the _Free Turn_ may be swapped for _Waning Resources_ instead (to replicate the harshness of the environment), or if the party is in mostly civilized lands (around a city or a fortress), the _Free Turn_ can be a _Good Encounter_ instead, even during the night, instead of discovering a hidden site, there may be an encounter at the party camp.

*Table X: Overloaded Wilderness Die*

| Roll  | Event             | Precision                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---: | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | Encounter         | The Referee rolls a random encounter appropriate for the current milieu.                                                                                   |
|   2   | Hidden Site       | The characters stumble upon a hidden site of the current hex.                                                                                              |
|   3   | Waning Resources  | The characters must rest and consume resources before venturing forth. They may either spend resources they have, or spend the next travel point foraging. |
|   4   | Change of Weather | The referee determines a new weather applicable for the milieu.                                                                                            |
|   5   | Free Turn         | Nothing specific happens, the characters can simply continue their journey unhindered.                                                                     |
|   6   | Good Encounter    | The Referee rolls a good random encounter appropriate for the current milieu (Helpful NPC, Secured Location, Resources are found, etc.).                   |

### Discovery

Features in an hex can have one of 3 visibility statuses: Overt, Hidden or Secret.

- __Overt features__ are visible and known by the characters immediately upon entering an hex, and some can even be used as landmarks (usually 1-in-6, as informed by the referee) for navigation to avoid getting lost. When used for navigation, such landmarks may be seen from 2 hexes afar, barring any terrain feature blocking the view (High Mountains, Deep Forests or Canopies, etc.).
- __Hidden features__ are only visible by the characters if they stumble upon them while traveling. They can be discovered randomly one at a time if the party spends 1 travel point searching through the hex, or they can be found specifically if the party knows what they are looking for and spends 2 travel points to look for it.
- __Secret Features__ may be hinted at by activity, signs found during encounters or at other sites of the hex or even rumors, but they can only be discovered if the party spends __all__ of its travel points at once searching through the hex. This search can only be started at the beginning of a travel day (when the party has not spent any travel point yet)
