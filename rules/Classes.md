# Class Templates

## Introduction

Player Characters start at level 1 and choose their first template during character creation. From level 2 onward, during [level up](./PlayerRules.md#Leveling-up-Training-with-the-masters), characters may choose additional class template to gain a few specialization bonus and tools. Characters cannot have more than 6 class templates in total.

Templates from different classes may be taken without restriction (mixing and matching is encouraged to customize and/or specialize your character), but they may only be taken in order, e.g. a "Fighter C" template may not be taken until the character has also taken the "A" and "B" template, but a "Pyromancer A" template may be taken along a "Cat-burglar B" template.

The Classes and Templates available selection should be tailored to the campaign run by the referee. Hereafter are some sample class templates suitable for any fantasy (low to mid-heroic fantasy) campaign.

If you wish to play a non-human, the Ancestry Templates are made for this. If you want to take Ancestry Templates, you must take the A template at level 1, after that, you can mix and match between Occupation Templates and your chosen Ancestry.

Each class template grants specialized abilities, as well as one [Action Die](#Action-Dices) of a specific type, and unique ways to use them in play. As a reminder from the rules, Action Dices are noted as such: Fighting Dice are abbreviated "F", Skill Dice "S" and Magic Dice "M". If a template lists two action die type, e.g. noted as "F/M", you choose only one of those type of die when you take the template, and write it on your character sheet.

## Occupation Templates

### Fighter

In this rule-set, Fighters are more about becoming heroes of legends, than about pure combat prowess. This class will give you means to inspire and recruit hirelings, and create your legend with your mighty deeds.

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 F|Mighty Deeds of Arm|
|B|+1 F|Start of a Legacy, Fray Attacks|
|C|+1 F|Leader of Men|
|D|+1 F|A Legend is Born|

Benefits:

* __Mighty Deeds of Arm__: While most adventurers can try and shove, grapple, trip opponents in combat, your prowess allows you to do so even while attacking. Before rolling for an attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed, and doing so, roll a Fighting Die with the attack. If the Fighting Die rolls a 3 or higher AND you hit with your attack, your daring maneuver succeeds, and you describe the resulting actions in addition to your damage.
* __Fray Attacks__: When attacking, you may spent Fighting Dices to injure foes of lesser might. You deal [sum] damage (no need to roll for attack, you automatically hit for this), that you can spread among enemies that have less HD than your level.
* __Start of a Legacy__: Your deeds of arm have become known throughout the realm, and with that so has your weapon. Give a name to your weapon, and now wielding it allows you to inspire allies and intimidate enemies. When an NPC rolls for morale, you may spend Fighting Dice to add them to the roll.
  * For allied NPC, morale is now the best 2 rolls of the dice pool
  * For enemy NPC, morale is now the worst 2 rolls of the dice pool
* __Leader of Men__: You attract the service of a squire, a level 1 Fighter A, as a Hench-person who doesn't count against your lifelong Hench-person limit. You may also employ +[templates] additional hirelings as a reduced wage rate (count them as one die lower on the dice chain for their salary).
* __A Legend is Born__: Your named weapon has become, through your renown and Fate itself, a legendary artifact; give it an epithet to complement its name. Your name, deeds and its story will be sung in the epics of years to come. It now grants its wielder (which would be you, for now...) an additional Fighting Die, as well as your choice of either a +1 bonus to both attack and damage, or a +1 to AC.

Mishaps:

* You trip over your feet, or suffer any other action unsightly of your prestige. The next morale check for your hirelings and henchpeople is rolled at a -2 malus.

### Specialist

A specialist is a master of tools, always a kit on hand, able to make do with jury-rigged tools if necessary.

As a specialist, you gain a Skill die for each template (noted in the table below), and you have space for your tools (as noted in the **I have that somewhere...** feature)

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 S|Never Unprepared, I have that somewhere...|
|B|+1 S|In a pinch|
|C|+1 S||
|D|+1 S|Jack of all Trades|

Features:

* __Never Unprepared__: While in town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, donâ€™t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.
* **I have that somewhere...**: You gain +[templates] equipment slots, which may be only used for specialist tools (lockpicking kits, climbing kit, etc. -> non-combat and non-magical tools) or for Unlabeled Packages.
* **In a pinch**: When trying a skill check, you may use a toolkit not quite made for the situation (e.g. climbing piton to try and pick a lock). If you fail the check, write a mark on this toolkit, and if you fail a second time with a marked toolkit, it is destroyed.
* __Jack of all Trades__: While making a skill check, if you use a specialist tool, you retain Skill Dices on a 4 or lower.

Mishaps:

* Your tools get nicked. Write a mark on the toolkit used, on the second mark the tool is destroyed. Note: Yes, this is cumulative with the **In a pinch** feature.
* 

**Starting Equipment**:

* 1 specialist toolkit of your choice
* 1 belt with many pouches
