# Spending Money

## Introduction

In this document are various unsorted rules and tools that players may use to help them while adventuring.

## Cost of living

Day-to-day expenses are aggregated in a weekly paid cost-of-living.

## Equipment

Good equipment is the lifeline of any respectable adventurer.

### Standard Equipment

### Magic Items

Magic items cannot be bought, they can only be found, received or created. They are indestructible, barring some specific ritual designed to destroy them.

## Henchpersons and Hirelings

There is a distinction between a Henchperson and a Hireling. Hireling are simply followers, paid to do a specific job for the character of the party, while Henchperson are lifelong companions, with their own goals and motivations.

### Henchpersons

As noted, Henchperson are actually lifelong companions, and as such, a PC has a lifetime henchperson limit of half its starting Charisma defense (rounded down), which need to be noted down during character creation. During adventures, each PC may only be accompanied by 1 henchperson, but they can change which companion they wish to adventure with while in a safe town (most likely in a town where that companion is currently residing).

Henchpersons are NPCs with class templates, or at least a general archetype (Fighter, Magic User, etc.), but are limited in level to half the current level of the PC they're related to. They are willing to risk their lives to protect their PC companion, but are not single minded, and may still make Morale check if the situation proves dire.

When a PC dies, the player may freely opt to "promote" a current henchperson as their new PC, and continue adventuring to avenge, mourn or pursue the legacy of their fallen comrade (or previous character at least). When this happen, the referee gives the player a character sheet (which may be a simplified PC sheet), for the remainder of the adventure, and as the adventure is concluded, the player may spend the same downtime as a level up to "retrain", or reorganize, their new PC class templates to suit their needs or wants.

As a suggestion to players, do not hesitate to listen to your companions tales, as their requests may provide a good source of adventure, and even open new opportunities. Who knows what can happen if the castaway daughter of a baron inherits her father's position?

### Hirelings

Hirelings, in contrast, are people salaried to do a specific job for the PC or party, who will not endanger their lives for treasure they will not see the color of.

Their characteristics are abstracted by a single die, along the dice chain `d4 > d6 > d8 > d10`, which represents their level, aptitude, and wage to be paid.
