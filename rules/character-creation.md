## 0. Read the Agendas

The Agendas are guidelines about the kind of game experience this rule-set aim to facilitate, you should familiarize with them [here](Agendas.md).

## 1. Roll your stats

Your stats are **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. For each, in order, roll 3d6, then note the smallest value rolled next to the stat: This is your **Attribute Bonus** (used when acting upon something). Then, add 10 to the bonus, and write that next to it: This is your **Attribute Defense** (used when resisting something).

You may, once, switch two of your stats if you wish for your character to have a specific area of proficiency: [See Attributes description in the main Rules](./PlayerRules.md#using-attributes).

After that, note down your [derived stats](./PlayerRules.md#Additional-Characteristics): Resilience, Lifetime number of Henchfolks, Max Inventory Size.

## 2. Choose (or roll) your first Class Template

At this point, you may decide that your character is not a human. While rare, dwarven, elven and even halfling adventurers are not unheard of. To mark your difference, you must take the first Template of the Ancestry you chose for your character to be.

If you decide to take an Occupation Template as your first, your character is a Human.

Write down the abilities given by your template, the kind of Action Die that it gives you on your character sheet, then note the given starting equipment in your inventory.

## 3. Roll for your background

Now, roll a d6 on the Background table for your chosen Template, and note down the result on your character sheet. Don't hesitate to reference it when making decision for your character.
Note the equipment given by your background in your inventory.

## 4. Choose your equipment

Your starting gold is (1d6 + 4) * 10 gp (between 50 and 100 gp). You also start with a backpack or a strapped satchel (your choice) to hold your gear, if your background or your template doesn't give you one.

Using the [Basic Fantasy Equipment Emporium](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/EE1-Equipment-Emporium-r24.pdf) as a reference, you can buy whatever complementary equipment you want, but be mindful of your inventory size. For ease of decision, you can look at page 20 (20 in the book/24 in the pdf) of the EE for starting packages.

Note that before actually going on an adventure, you may hire Hirelings with the remaining money.

## 5. Decide who you are and why you are here

### A. Choose a Name

A full name to remind you of home, merely a first name, a nickname, a moniker you have been going by for a while,... Give a name to your character to bring them out into the campaign world. There is no limit to your imagination, but remember that complicated names may spur nicknames from your fellow adventurers.

### B. Describe your character

No need to go into full details about the physique of your character, a general description and one or two distinctive traits can help materialize your character in your mind and in the mind of your fellow players. You can use the [Knave character traits PDF](docs/character-traits.pdf) as a reference.

### C. Find a reason for your character to be adventuring in this campaign rather than staying at home

Ask your referee about the scope of the campaign, then decide why your character wishes to participate. They may have personal goals, be travelling with another character, be forced to be here, etc. What matters is why they would start adventuring, and why they would continue adventuring when danger bares its fangs.
