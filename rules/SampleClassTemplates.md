# Class Templates

## Introduction

Here are some sample class templates suitable for any fantasy (low to mid-heroic fantasy) campaign.

Regarding Ancestry templates, your character may only progress in one ancestry "class", and you, as a player, may declare your character to be of any race (present in the setting, check with your referee) you wish without taking any ancestry templates: Those templates are here for player characters who wish to reinforce their appartenance to their ancestry and culture by gaining mechanical benefits.

As a reminder from the rules, Action Dices are noted as such: Fighting Dice are abbreviated "F", Skill Dice "S" and Magic Dice "M". If a template lists two action die type, e.g. noted as "F/M", you choose only one of those type of die when you take the template, and write it on your character sheet.

## Occupation Templates

#### Fighter

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 F|Mighty Deeds of Arm|
|B|+1 F|Start of a Legacy, Extra Attack|
|C|+1 F|Leader of Men|
|D|+1 F|A Legend is Born|

* __Mighty Deeds of Arm__: While most adventurers can try and shove, grapple, trip opponents in combat, your prowess allows you to do so even while attacking. Before rolling for an attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed, and doing so, roll a Fighting Die with the attack. If the Fighting Die rolls a 3 or higher AND you hit with your attack, your daring maneuver succeeds, and you describe the resulting actions in addition to your damage.
* __Extra Attack__: You may do an extra attack during each combat round.
* __Start of a Legacy__: Your deeds of arm have become known throughout the realm, and with that so has your weapon. Give a name to your weapon, and now wielding it allows you to inspire allies and intimidate enemies. When an NPC rolls for morale, you may spend Fighting Dice to add them to the roll.
    - For allied NPC, morale is now the best 2 rolls of the dice pool
    - For enemy NPC, morale is now the worst 2 rolls of the dice pool
* __Leader of Men__: You attract the service of a squire, a level 1 Fighter A, as a Hench-person who doesn't count against your lifelong Hench-person limit. You may also employ +[templates] additional hirelings as a reduced wage rate (count them as one die lower on the dice chain for their salary).
* __A Legend is Born__: Your named weapon has become, through your renown and Fate itself, a legendary artifact; give it an epithet to complement its name. Your name, deeds and its story will be sung in the epics of years to come. It now grants its wielder (which would be you, for now...) an additional Fighting Die, as well as your choice of either a +1 bonus to both attack and damage, or a +1 to AC.
