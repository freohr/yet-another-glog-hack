# Dwarves

Dwarves are golems. Free-willed, sapient golems, created by other sapient golems. Chiseled from stone, eyes inlaid with jewels, the essence of the Law carved and hammered into their bodies with holy blows. Dwarves are born with the knowledge of enchantment and golemancy, arts which humans labor whole lifetimes to learn. They must know them, for that is the only way to create more of their kind.

Of course, that is only the beginning. But let's leave a little to be revealed.

## Benefits

As a Dwarf, you gain a Dwarf die with every template, which may be used either as a Fighting Die or a Skill die

| Template | Action Die  | Benefit               |
| :------: | :---------: | :-------------------- |
|    A     | +1 Dw (F/S) | Born of Stone         |
|    B     | +1 Dw (F/S) | Golemancer            |
|    C     | +1 Dw (F/S) | Specialized Golemancy |
|    D     | +1 Dw (F/S) | Master Golemancer     |

- **Born of Stone**:
  - As you have been created by you peers, you can be remade by your peers. If you were to die, and your remains were brought to a Dwarven Hold, you can be remade in a week, plus a week for each Stone Scar you already bear. However, as this task is more difficult than creating a Dwarf from scratch, you gain a Stone Scar as a permanent wound.
- **Golemancer**:
  - You have begun learning the ancient art of Dwarven Golemancy. You can [reserve] Dwarf Dice to create a golem Hireling, starting at `Hd4` with a single [reserved] Die, and increasing up the hireling die chain for each additional Die reserved. The golem creation process take one day per [reserved] die, and you cannot have more than 1 golem Hireling at the same time.
- **Specialized Golemancy**:
  - When creating a golem Hireling, you can freely choose a specialty for it. This includes the possibility of creating a Magic User Golem, provided you create the Golem with the help of a Magic User of the school you want your golem to specialize in.
- **Master Golemancer**:
  - As your learning of Golemancy reaches its peak, you are now able to infuse your golem with Dwarfhood.
    - To create a Dwarf, you need to create a Golem with 4 [reserved] Dwarven die, then go on adventures, and spend your XP not on your own learning, but on you Golem to mold it as a Dwarf.
    - Note however, that this process becomes more tiring and complex for each Dwarf you give rise to, requiring more XP;
    - Track the XP you infuse your golem with as you would your own, and as long as the golem you're currently rising is not destroyed during adventures, you can mold it as a Dwarf each time you pass the XP threshold for a new level (i.e. as you track Golem XP, you can create a dwarf at the level 1 threshold, then at the level 2 threshold, etc.).
  - Additionally, when you assist in the reconstruction of a fellow Dwarf, reduce the needed time by half.
