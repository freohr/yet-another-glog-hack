- **Spells**
  - When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list below. You cannot change schools later. [You are a spellcaster](../magic/magic-rules.md).
  - You have a number of spell slots in your brain equal to your number of Magic Dice. Which means that if you got Magic Dice from another class, you still got those spell slots (you still need to know the spells themselves to put them into slots).
  - When you gain a Wizard template, roll the "Known spell die" for this template on your School spell list. You gain those spells a part of your level up (you may reroll duplicates, but having duplicates of some spells may come in handy).
  - Whenever you cast a spell, make a mark next to it to count of many times you have cast it. This is used in features from further templates.
- **Spell Breeding**
  - You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:
    1. a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)
    2. a random spell from a random spell list (randomly select the list from the school table, then roll 1d10)
    3. a [mutant version](../magic/magic-rules.md#spell-mutations) of one of the two spells
  - Note that yes, this consumes both spell scrolls.
  - When the process is complete, Save (no stat, a straight `d20 > 15`) or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus to the roll for
    1. every 1 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade
    2. the number of Wizard templates you possess
    3. each ritual preparation you describe to the GM
    4. the number of times you'd previously cast the spells you are combining
- **Book Casting**
  - You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll.
  - This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.
  - When using this in combat, you must declare you are casting a spell from a book before any other participant declares their action. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round.
- **Friendly Spell**
  - Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a [positive mutation](../magic/magic-rules.md#spell-mutations) to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.
- **Master of Magics**
  - Learn up to 6 spells from your schoolâ€™s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (Work through it with your Referee).
