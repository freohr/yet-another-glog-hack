# Specialist

A specialist is a master of tools, always a kit on hand, able to make do with jury-rigged tools if necessary.

## Benefits

As a specialist, you gain a Skill die for each template.

| Template | Action Die | Benefit                                    |
| :------: | :--------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    A     |    +1 S    | Never Unprepared, I have that somewhere... |
|    B     |    +1 S    | In a pinch                                 |
|    C     |    +1 S    | Tool Tinkering                             |
|    D     |    +1 S    | Jack of all Trades                         |

- **Never Unprepared**
  - While in town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, donâ€™t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.
- **I have that somewhere...**:
  - You gain +[templates] equipment slots, which may be only used for specialist tools (lockpicking kits, climbing kit, etc. -> non-combat and non-magical tools) or for Unlabeled Packages.
- **In a pinch**:
  - When trying a skill check, you may use a toolkit not quite made for the situation (e.g. climbing piton to try and pick a lock). If you fail the check, the toolkit lose 1 point of durability.
- **Tool Tinkering**:
  - You can attempt to merge tools and toolkits to create your own multi-tool. A Multi-tool takes only 1 slot for each 3 distinct tools it contains. A multi-tool value is the sum of the values of each of its tools.
    1. Choose 2 toolkits you own (one may be an already made multi-tool), and spend 1 week tinkering on them.
    2. When the process is complete, Save (straight) or suffer a Mishap. Adjust the roll as following:
       - +1 for each 1 gp you spend on material to work on the kit
       - +1 for each additional day of work beyond the initial week
       - -1 for each missing point of durability on either toolkit
       - -1 for each distinct tool beyond the first when working on multi-tools (adding to or merging multi-tools is harder)
- **Jack of all Trades**: While making a skill check with tools, you retain Skill Dices on a 4 or lower.

## Mishaps

- Your tools get nicked. The toolkit you used lose 1 point of durability.
- Fatigue starts to set in. Mark off 1 inventory slot until your next full rest.
- You cut yourself on a piece of metal or wood that sticks out. Roll a Minor Injury.
