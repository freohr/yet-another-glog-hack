# Elves

[Inspired by Skerples' Elves](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/05/osr-elves-and-elf-wizards.html)

You may have been born human, but having attracted the interest of a Fey, you didn't stay one for long. Take a human body and fix the mistakes. Organize teeth. Fix eyesight. Improve hearing. Improve skin. Build in a resistance to disease, age, and fear. Clean up the chaos of the mind. You are an improved human. You are better than them because you have been designed to be better than them.

## Benefits

As an Elf, you gain an Elf die with every template, which may be used either as Fighting Dice or as Magic Dice

- **Fey Sculpted**:
  - You deepen your connection to the Fey Realms. You cannot die of age.
  - *Iron Bane*: You roll a _Minor Wound + [templates]_ whenever you touch iron.
  - *Elven Magic*: You are a [spellcaster](../magic/magic-rules.md), using the [Elven school of Magic](../magic/spell-schools.md#elven-wizard). You start with one spell, which you get by rolling a d6 on the Elven Spell table.
- **Oath Bound**:
  - You can no longer lie, and you may bound someone to their word by [Holding X] Magic Die. Whenever that person breaks their word, they roll a **Major Injury + [X]**.
- **Fey Sight**:
  - You can see invisible things. Such as spells and emotions. You also see people who frequently lie. They look less... real, defined, then everything else. Cannot be turned off yet it can be ignored.
- **Elven Antlers**:
  - You grow antlers on your forehead; describe their appearance (as a deer, either stag or doe, a moose, or any kind of cervidae). Your elven nature is now plain to see: Gain a +1 bonus to reactions when interacting with fey creatures, druids and woodland beings, but you give a -1 malus to reaction to your group when in presence of city and mountains dwellers (Humans, Dwarves, etc.).
- **Fey Magic**:
  - Choose 2 additional spells from the known elven spells, or create a spell from scratch.
