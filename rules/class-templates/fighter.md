# Fighter

In this rule-set, Fighters are more about becoming heroes of legends, than about pure combat prowess. This class will give you means to inspire and recruit hirelings, and create your legend with your mighty deeds.

## Benefits

As a Fighter, you gain Fighting Die with every template.

| Template | Action Die | Benefit                         |
| :------: | :--------: | :------------------------------ |
|    A     |    +1 F    | Mighty Deeds of Arm             |
|    B     |    +1 F    | Start of a Legacy, Fray Attacks |
|    C     |    +1 F    | Leader of Men                   |
|    D     |    +1 F    | A Legend is Born                |

- __Mighty Deeds of Arm__:
  - While most adventurers can try and shove, grapple, trip opponents in combat, your prowess allows you to do so even while attacking. Before rolling for an attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed: describe your intended maneuver, then roll a Fighting Die with the attack. If the Fighting Die rolls a 3 or higher AND you hit with your attack, your maneuver succeeds, and you describe the resulting actions in addition to your damage.
- __Fray Attacks__:
  - When attacking, you may spent Fighting Dices to injure foes of lesser might. TBI
- __Start of a Legacy__:
  - Your deeds of arm have become known throughout the realm, and with that so has your weapon. Give a name to your weapon, and now wielding it allows you to inspire allies and intimidate enemies. When an NPC rolls for morale, you may spend Fighting Dice to add them to the roll.
    - For allied NPC, increase the Morale roll by [highest].
    - For enemy NPC, reduce the Morale roll by [highest].
- __Leader of Men__:
  - You attract the service of a squire, a level 1 Fighter A, as a Hench-person who doesn't count against your lifelong Hench-person limit.
  - You may also employ +[templates] additional hirelings, and hirelings you employ count as one die lower on the chain for their wage (e.g. a `Hd8` hireling ony needs wages of a `Hd6` hireling while serving you).
- __A Legend is Born__:
  - Your named weapon has become, through your renown and Fate itself, a legendary artifact; give it an epithet to complement its name. Your name, deeds and its story will be sung in the epics of years to come. It now grants its wielder (which would be you, for now) an additional Fighting Die, as well as your choice of either a +1 bonus to both attack and damage, or a +1 to AC.

## Mishaps

1. You trip over your feet, or suffer any other action unsightly of your prestige. The next morale check for your hirelings and henchfolks is rolled at a -2 malus.
2. Bad movement results in dents to your equipment. If you were attacking, your weapon lose 1 durability; if you were defending, your armor or your shield lose 1 durability.
