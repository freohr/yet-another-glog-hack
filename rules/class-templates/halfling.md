# Halflings

Halflings impersonate supernatural luck, and their boastful story telling reflects that. Some scholars actually believe that halflings are not born naturally, but that they manifest from the aether as the stories tell the ever increasing luck of their halfling protagonists.

## Benefits

As an Halfling, you gain an Halfling die with every template, which may be used either as a Magic die or a Skill die.
