## Introduction

Player Characters start at level 1 and choose their first template during character creation. From level 2 onward, during [level up](./PlayerRules.md#Leveling-up-Training-with-the-masters), characters may choose additional class template to gain a few specialization bonus and tools. Characters cannot have more than 6 class templates in total.

Templates from different classes may be taken without restriction (mixing and matching is encouraged to customize and/or specialize your character), but they may only be taken in order, e.g. a "Fighter C" template may not be taken until the character has also taken the "A" and "B" template, but a "Pyromancer A" template may be taken along a "Cat-burglar B" template.

The Classes and Templates available selection should be tailored to the campaign run by the referee. Hereafter are some sample class templates suitable for any fantasy (low to mid-heroic fantasy) campaign.

If you wish to play a non-human, the Ancestry Templates are made for this. If you want to take Ancestry Templates, you must take the A template at level 1, after that, you can mix and match between Occupation Templates and your chosen Ancestry.

Each class template grants specialized abilities, as well as one [Action Die](#Action-Dices) of a specific type, and unique ways to use them in play. As a reminder from the rules, Action Dices are noted as such: Fighting Dice are abbreviated "F", Skill Dice "S" and Magic Dice "M". If a template lists two action die type, e.g. noted as "F/M" (Fighting/Magic), declare you which specific type you choose for the roll as you roll.
