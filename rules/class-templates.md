## Introduction

Player Characters start at level 1 and choose their first template during character creation. From level 2 onward, during [level up](./PlayerRules.md#Leveling-up-Training-with-the-masters), characters may choose additional class template to gain a few specialization bonus and tools. Characters cannot have more than 6 class templates in total.

Templates from different classes may be taken without restriction (mixing and matching is encouraged to customize and/or specialize your character), but they may only be taken in order, e.g. a "Fighter C" template may not be taken until the character has also taken the "A" and "B" template, but a "Pyromancer A" template may be taken along a "Cat-burglar B" template.

The Classes and Templates available selection should be tailored to the campaign run by the referee. Hereafter are some sample class templates suitable for any fantasy (low to mid-heroic fantasy) campaign.

If you wish to play a non-human, the Ancestry Templates are made for this. If you want to take Ancestry Templates, you must take the A template at level 1, after that, you can mix and match between Occupation Templates and your chosen Ancestry.

Each class template grants specialized abilities, as well as one [Action Die](#Action-Dices) of a specific type, and unique ways to use them in play. As a reminder from the rules, Action Dices are noted as such: Fighting Dice are abbreviated "F", Skill Dice "S" and Magic Dice "M". If a template lists two action die type, e.g. noted as "F/M", you choose only one of those type of die when you take the template, and write it on your character sheet.

## Occupation Templates

### Fighter

In this rule-set, Fighters are more about becoming heroes of legends, than about pure combat prowess. This class will give you means to inspire and recruit hirelings, and create your legend with your mighty deeds.

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 F|Mighty Deeds of Arm|
|B|+1 F|Start of a Legacy, Fray Attacks|
|C|+1 F|Leader of Men|
|D|+1 F|A Legend is Born|

Benefits:

- __Mighty Deeds of Arm__: While most adventurers can try and shove, grapple, trip opponents in combat, your prowess allows you to do so even while attacking. Before rolling for an attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed, and doing so, roll a Fighting Die with the attack. If the Fighting Die rolls a 3 or higher AND you hit with your attack, your daring maneuver succeeds, and you describe the resulting actions in addition to your damage.
- __Fray Attacks__: When attacking, you may spent Fighting Dices to injure foes of lesser might. You deal [sum] damage (no need to roll for attack, you automatically hit for this), that you can spread among enemies that have less HD than your level.
- __Start of a Legacy__: Your deeds of arm have become known throughout the realm, and with that so has your weapon. Give a name to your weapon, and now wielding it allows you to inspire allies and intimidate enemies. When an NPC rolls for morale, you may spend Fighting Dice to add them to the roll.
  - For allied NPC, subtract -[highest] from the morale roll
  - For enemy NPC, add +[highest] to the morale roll
  - *Reminder*: As morale is roll under, a lower score is better.
- __Leader of Men__: You attract the service of a squire, a level 1 Fighter A, as a Hench-person who doesn't count against your lifelong Hench-person limit. You may also employ +[templates] additional hirelings as a reduced wage rate (count them as one die lower on the dice chain for their salary).
- __A Legend is Born__: Your named weapon has become, through your renown and Fate itself, a legendary artifact; give it an epithet to complement its name. Your name, deeds and its story will be sung in the epics of years to come. It now grants its wielder (which would be you, for now...) an additional Fighting Die, as well as your choice of either a +1 bonus to both attack and damage, or a +1 to AC.

**Mishaps**:

- You trip over your feet, or suffer any other action unsightly of your prestige. The next morale check for your hirelings and henchpeople is rolled at a +2 malus.
- Bad movement results in dents to your equipment. If you were attacking, your weapon lose 1 durability; if you were defending, your armor or your shield lose 1 durability.

**Starting Equipment**:

- Leather armor
- Either sword and shield, or bow and d10 arrows

**Previous Profession** (before your adventuring life), and a starting item:

1. Berserker: A tankard of ale, and a cool tattoo
2. Caravan Guard: A sturdy spear, and a donkey
3. Noble: An expensive fur-lined cloak, and a gold family signet ring
4. Labourer: A tool-belt containing a hammer and nails
5. Sailor: A bottle of grog, and a spyglass
6. Watchman: A lantern and a 10ft pole

### Magic-User

[Adjusted from Skerples' Wizard](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html)

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 M|Magic School, +2 Known Spells (d6), Spell Breeding|
|B|+1 M|+1 Known Spell (d8), Book Casting|
|C|+1 M|+1 Known Spell (d10), Friendly Spell|
|D|+1 M|Master of Magics|

- **Spells**
  - When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list below. You cannot change schools later. [You are a spellcaster](magic/magic-rules.md).
  - You have a number of spell slots in your brain equal to your number of Magic Dice. Which means that if you got Magic Dice from another class, you still got those spell slots (you still need to know the spells themselves to put them into slots).
  - When you gain a Wizard template, roll the die for this template on your School spell list. You gain those spells a part of your level up (you may reroll duplicates, but having duplicates of some spells may come in handy).
  - Whenever you cast a spell, make a mark next to it to count of many times you have cast it. This is used in features from further templates.
- **Spell Breeding**
  - You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1 week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the following:
    1. a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)
    2. a random spell from a random spell list (randomly select the list from the school table, then roll 1d10)
    3. a [mutant version](magic/magic-rules.md#spell-mutations) of one of the two spells
  - Note that yes, this consumes both spell scrolls.
  - When the process is complete, Save (no stat, a straight d20 > 15) or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus to the roll for
    1. every 1 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other tools of your trade
    2. the number of Wizard templates you possess
    3. each ritual preparation you describe to the GM
    4. the number of times you'd previously cast the spells you are combining
- **Book Casting**
  - You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll.
  - This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.
  - When using this in combat, you must declare you are casting a spell from a book before any other participant declares their action. You automatically go last in the initiative round, losing any opposed initiative roll, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round.
- **Friendly Spell**
  - Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a [positive mutation](magic/magic-rules.md#spell-mutations) to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.
- **Master of Magics**
  - Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (Work through it with your Referee).

**Magic Spell Schools** (choose 1-6 or roll a d6):

1. Orthodox Wizard
2. White Wizard
3. Elementalist Wizard
4. Illusionist Wizard
5. Necromancer
6. Spell-thief
7. Do ya feel lucky, punk? [Well, do ya? (roll a d120)](http://attnam.blogspot.com/2018/08/d50-glog-wizard-schools.html)

**Starting Equipment**:

- A spellbook with your starting spells
- Travelling Robes (may be customized to represent your school of magic)
- A big pointy hat (describe it to the table)

**Previous Profession** (before your adventuring life), and a starting item:

1. Astronomer: a star chart and a sextant
2. Archivist: Writing journal, ink and Quill
3. Fortune Teller: a deck of Tarot cards, and a candelabra
4. Professor: a piece of chalk, reading glasses and a stern look
5. Runesmith: a set of engraving tools
6. Soothsayer: a pouch of animal bonelets, and a polished human skull

### Specialist

A specialist is a master of tools, always a kit on hand, able to make do with jury-rigged tools if necessary.

As a specialist, you gain a Skill die for each template (noted in the table below), and you have space for your tools (as noted in the **I have that somewhere...** feature)

|Template|Action Die|Benefit|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|A|+1 S|Never Unprepared, I have that somewhere...|
|B|+1 S|In a pinch|
|C|+1 S|Tool Tinkering|
|D|+1 S|Jack of all Trades|

Features:

- **Never Unprepared**: While in town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don’t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.
- **I have that somewhere...**: You gain +[templates] equipment slots, which may be only used for specialist tools (lockpicking kits, climbing kit, etc. -> non-combat and non-magical tools) or for Unlabeled Packages.
- **In a pinch**: When trying a skill check, you may use a toolkit not quite made for the situation (e.g. climbing piton to try and pick a lock). If you fail the check, the toolkit lose 1 point of durability.
- **Tool Tinkering**: You can attempt to merge tools and toolkits to create your own multi-tool. A Multi-tool takes only 1 slot for each 3 distinct tools it contains. A multi-tool value is the sum of the values of each of its tools.
  1. Choose 2 toolkits you own (one may be an already made multi-tool), and spend 1 week tinkering on them.
  2. When the process is complete, Save (straight) or suffer a Mishap. Adjust the roll as following:
       - +1 for each 1 gp you spend on material to work on the kit
       - +1 for each additional day of work beyond the initial week
       - -1 for each missing point of durability on either toolkit
       - -1 for each distinct tool beyond the first when working on multi-tools (adding to or merging multi-tools is harder)
- **Jack of all Trades**: While making a skill check with tools, you retain Skill Dices on a 4 or lower.

**Mishaps**:

- Your tools get nicked. The toolkit you used lose 1 point of durability.
- Fatigue starts to set in. Mark off 1 inventory slot until your next full rest.
- You cut yourself on a piece of metal or wood that sticks out. Take 1d4 damage (Roll a minor injury (d4)).

**Starting Equipment**:

- 1 specialist toolkit of your choice
- 1 belt with many pouches

**Previous Profession** (before your adventuring life)

1. Artisan (manufacturing trade of your choice): 1 unit of trade supplies, and a crumpled list of orders
2. Artist. (medium of your choice (painter, sculptor, etc.)): Art supplies and a fancy hat
3. Butler: A "small repairs" toolkit, and a proper attire.
4. Forger: an mold of a minted coin, and a bounty on your head from a faraway land
5. Spy: a dark cloak, and an encoded IOU
