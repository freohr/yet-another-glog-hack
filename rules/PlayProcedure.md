## Turn-based Procedures: Overloaded Encounter Die

_Original Idea from Necropraxis : [Overloading the encounter die](http://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/), and various refinement from around the OSR online communities_

Play in this OSR Game is based around time and resources management, and this is represented by turn-based procedures for combat, dungeon exploration and wilderness exploration. Resource management is represented as a number of turns between which players must spend those resources (food, water, light, etc.) or face varying penalties to their group during exploration.

To simplify accounting, this game replace and merges the random encounter roll and fixed durations for each resource with an overloaded encounter die, rolled at the start of each turn, which will determine what initial situation the players need to handle before continuing their voyage. Here is the basic of this overloaded die:

|Die Face| Event| Precision|
|:-:|:--|:--|
|1|Encounter| The Referee rolls a random encounter appropriate for the current milieu.|
|2|Environment Effect| The Referee rolls an environment effect appropriate for the current milieu (Omen of the next encounter in a dungeon, Change of weather in the wild or at sea, etc.)|
|3|Forced Rest| The players must take the current turn to rest and consume food and water.|
|4|Waning Resources| The players must reignite their light source (either a new torch, or another dose of oil), and Spell Effects end.|
|5|Free Turn| Nothing specific happens, the players can simply continue their exploration unhindered.|
|6|Good Encounter| The Referee rolls a good random encounter appropriate for the current milieu (Helpful NPC, Secured Location, Resources are found, etc.).|
