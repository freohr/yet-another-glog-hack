## White Mage

[Initial idea from Meidos & Monsters](https://blog.waifu.haus/homebrew/white-mage/)

White Mages are beloved healers and sought-after companions. They’re easily recognisable by their voluminous white robes with red, triangle-shaped trimming.

**Perk**: So long as you’re dressed like a White Mage, you find it easy to convince people you’re doing good work (everyone trusts you easier). Similarly, mercenaries will be more willing to follow you (because they know you’ll take care of them). You start with the signature robes of your school.

**Drawback**: You cannot use, or even own, edged weapons (swords, arrows/bolts, axes, etc). The clergy don’t like white mages (for encroaching on their territory).

### White Cantrips

* You can consume a MD to light your finger, the end of a staff, etc. The light is as bright as that of a normal torch or lantern. The consumed MD will return to you after a turn of not casting spells or cantrips.
* You can relieve someone of pain from a very minor injury (nick, dislocated joint) by licking it. This heals no more than 1HP in game terms, no matter how long you spend doing it.
* Water that has been in your mouth is purified.

### White Spells

Start with Cure, and roll 1d5+1 (or 1d6, re-rolling 1) for your second starting spell.

1. **Cure**
   * R: Touch
   * Target is healed for [sum]+[dice] HP. Any debilitating conditions from recent combats are also cured.
2. **Protection from Evil**
   * D: [dice] minutes R: varies
   * Target can’t be attacked or targeted with spells by inherently evil creatures, such as demons or undead. The spell is broken if the target attacks or casts a spell. Evil creatures with HD greater than 2x[dice] can save to attempt to overcome this protection.
   * The range depends on the [dice] and includes yourself:
      * 1-2: touch
      * 3: 10’ radius
      * 4: Small building
      * 5: Fortress
3. **Protect**
    * D: [dice] turns R: touch
    * Target gains magical armor. AC as plate + [dice], and they still get their bonus for using a shield. Treat the armor as magical for the purposes of e.g. getting attacked by something that degrades non-magical armor.
4. **Silence**
    * D: [dice] minutes R: 20’ radius
    * No sound can be emitted in the radius.
5. **Turn Undead**
    * R: 50’ D: [dice] turns
    * [sum]+[dice] HD of undead creatures flee in terror. If the [dice] spent are greater than the undead creature’s HD, they are instead destroyed and crumble to dust. If you roll this spell twice, you gain a second spell that works against demons or devils instead of undead.
6. **Protection from Elements**
    * R: 30’ D: [dice]×2 turns
    * Target gains immunity to natural elemental damage (such as fire or cold). They also gain a +2 per [dice] bonus to saves against magical sources of elemental damage (dragonfire, lightning bolts, magical frost, etc).
7. **Create Water**
    * The mage creates a magical spring, with water enough for [dice]×6 human-sized creatures and their mounts - 25 gallons per die.
8. **Create Food**
    * The mage creates food enough for [dice]×6 human-sized creatures.
9. Antimagic Field
    * D: 1 minute R: self
    * The field emanates from you in a radius of 10’. Spells cast with spell dice equal to or less than [dice] within this radius have no effect.
10. Dispel Evil
    * R: 15×[dice]’ D: [dice] turns
    * Evil creatures struck by this spell will be destroyed or banished, or (if they save) will flee in terror.
11. Restoration
    * R: touch
    * Restores [dice] lost levels (by level drain) to a character. Does not stack with subsequent castings; it must be done all at once.
12. Quest
    * R: 30'
    * Targeted creature must save or be sent on a quest, of the caster’s choice. They must follow this task or be cursed. The quest can only be dispelled by another caster who knows Quest, expending the same amount of MD as the original caster, to cast Dispel Quest. Casters who know Quest automatically know Dispel Quest.

### Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours.
2. Take 1d6 damage.
3. Your healing spells have a 2-in-6 chance of harming for a turn.
4. You must watch something die before you can cast a healing spell again.
5. Panic for 1d6 rounds
6. Your hands seize up painfully. You can’t do anything requiring fine motor skills, including casting spells, for 1d6 rounds.

### Doom of the White Mage

1. You go blind for three days.
2. You cannot cast spells for a week.
3. You lose your mind and become permanently unable to speak or cast spells. Kind party members might relieve you of your wizardly robes and send you off to a monastery.

You can avoid this doom by swearing an oath of non-violence on the heart of an angel or pit fiend.
