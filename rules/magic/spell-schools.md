# Magic User Spells

Notation for spells:

* R: Radius
* T: Number of targets
* D: Duration. Concentration means as long as you can dedicate yourself to maintaining the spell.

Notation for Dice:

* [sum]: Roll the dices, then add all the values
* [dice]: The number of dice rolled
* [highest]: Roll the dices, then use the highest rolled value
* [Hold X]: Reduces your maximum MD by X, the effect last until you recover your MD, you can choose to end the effect prematurely, but you only recover the dice on your next full rest.

## Orthodox Wizard

[Taken from Skerples' Orthodox Wizard](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-orthodox-wizards.html)

**Perk**: You start with red robes.

**Drawback**: None.

**Cantrips**

1. Change the colour or texture of an object no larger than a horse for 10 minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on your fingertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book, but you couldn't open a door or lift a stone.

Having no drawback is a rarity, even if your perks and cantrips aren't very impressive. They are good classic orthodox cantrips.

### Orthodox Wizard Spell List

An Orthodox Wizard can roll on the [100 Orthodox Spell List](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-100-orthodox-spells.html) instead of rolling on the list below. Results may vary.

1. Lock
   * R: 50' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 10 minutes
   * Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its scabbard). Requires Str 10 + [dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature's orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns.
2. Knock
    * R: 50' T: [dice] objects D: 0
    * Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 + [dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target is an unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.
3. Grease
    * R: 50' T: object, surface D: [dice]x2 rounds
    * Can be cast directly on a creature or [sum]10' x 10' surfaces. Creatures moving across the area must Save vs Dexterity or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.
4. Force Field
    * R: 10' T: plane or sphere D: concentration
    * Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10' away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter (large enough for the caster and +1 person). The force field has [sum] HP. All attacks against it hit.
5. Levitate
    * R: 50' T: creature object D: concentration
    * You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is [dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.
6. Magic Missile
    * R: 200' T: creature D: 0
    * Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save. As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you, and can be any colour, shape, or pattern you describe.
7. Feather Fall
    * R: 10’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0
    * If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late).
8. Sleep
    * R: 50' T: creature D: 10 min
    * Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action). Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)
9. Light
    * R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours
    * Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.
10. Wizard Vision
    * R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent
    * If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.
    * If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects:
      * (a) You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else.
      * (b) You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.
    * The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers).

**Emblem Spells**

11. Prismatic Ray
    * R: 200' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0
    * Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10:
      1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half.
      2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates.
      3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, save for half.
      4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, save for half.
      5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, save for half.
      6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save negates
      7. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save
      8. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save
      9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save.
      10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.
12. Fireball
    * R: 200' T: 20' diameter D: 0
    * Does [sum] fire damage to all objects.

**Mechanical Notes on the Orthodox Wizard Spell List**

All the classics are represented. This school has access to some very powerful problem-solving tools, but the temptation to roll on that big 100 spell table can be overpowering. You can't go very wrong with the "basic" orthodox wizard spell set.

### Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Lose 1 MD for 24 hours.
5. Agony for 1d6 rounds.
6. Cannot cast spells for 1d6 rounds.

### Doom of the Orthodox

1. Lose the ability to cast spells for 1 day.
2. Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days.
3. Lose the ability to cast spells permanently.

This doom can be eating the heart of a powerful magical creature, such as a High Elf or a dragon, or by marrying one. You can also fill your brain with 4 entirely new spells that have never been cast by anyone else.

## White Wizard

[Initial idea from Meidos & Monsters](https://blog.waifu.haus/homebrew/white-mage/)

White Wizards are beloved healers and sought-after companions. They’re easily recognizable by their voluminous white robes with red, triangle-shaped trimming.

**Perk**: So long as you’re dressed like a White Mage, you find it easy to convince people you’re doing good work (everyone trusts you easier). Similarly, mercenaries will be more willing to follow you (because they know you’ll take care of them).

**Starting Equipment**: You start with the signature robes of your school.

**Drawback**: You cannot use, or even own, edged weapons (swords, arrows/bolts, axes, etc). The clergy don’t like white mages (for encroaching on their territory).

### White Cantrips

* You can consume a MD to light your finger, the end of a staff, etc. The light is as bright as that of a normal torch or lantern. The consumed MD will return to you after a turn of not casting spells or cantrips.
* You can relieve someone of pain from a very minor injury (nick, dislocated joint) by licking it. This heals no more than 1HP in game terms, no matter how long you spend doing it.
* Water that has been in your mouth is purified.

### White Spells

Start with Cure, and roll 1d5+1 (or 1d6, re-rolling 1) for your second starting spell.

1. **Cure**
   * R: Touch
   * Target is healed for [sum]+[dice] HP. Any debilitating conditions from recent combats are also cured.
2. **Protection from Evil**
   * D: [dice] minutes R: varies
   * Target can’t be attacked or targeted with spells by inherently evil creatures, such as demons or undead. The spell is broken if the target attacks or casts a spell. Evil creatures with HD greater than 2x[dice] can save to attempt to overcome this protection.
   * The range depends on the [dice] and includes yourself:
      * 1-2: touch
      * 3: 10’ radius
      * 4: Small building
      * 5: Fortress
3. **Protect**
    * D: [dice] turns R: touch
    * Target gains magical armor. AC as plate + [dice], and they still get their bonus for using a shield. Treat the armor as magical for the purposes of e.g. getting attacked by something that degrades non-magical armor.
4. **Silence**
    * D: [dice] minutes R: 20’ radius
    * No sound can be emitted in the radius.
5. **Turn Undead**
    * R: 50’ D: [dice] turns
    * [sum]+[dice] HD of undead creatures flee in terror. If the [dice] spent are greater than the undead creature’s HD, they are instead destroyed and crumble to dust. If you roll this spell twice, you gain a second spell that works against demons or devils instead of undead.
6. **Protection from Elements**
    * R: 30’ D: [dice]×2 turns
    * Target gains immunity to natural elemental damage (such as fire or cold). They also gain a +2 per [dice] bonus to saves against magical sources of elemental damage (dragonfire, lightning bolts, magical frost, etc).
7. **Create Water**
    * The mage creates a magical spring, with water enough for [dice]×6 human-sized creatures and their mounts - 25 gallons per die.
8. **Create Food**
    * The mage creates food enough for [dice]×6 human-sized creatures.
9. Antimagic Field
    * D: 1 minute R: self
    * The field emanates from you in a radius of 10’. Spells cast with spell dice equal to or less than [dice] within this radius have no effect.
10. Dispel Evil
    * R: 15×[dice]’ D: [dice] turns
    * Evil creatures struck by this spell will be destroyed or banished, or (if they save) will flee in terror.
11. Restoration
    * R: touch
    * Restores [dice] lost levels (by level drain) to a character. Does not stack with subsequent castings; it must be done all at once.
12. Quest
    * R: 30'
    * Targeted creature must save or be sent on a quest, of the caster’s choice. They must follow this task or be cursed. The quest can only be dispelled by another caster who knows Quest, expending the same amount of MD as the original caster, to cast Dispel Quest. Casters who know Quest automatically know Dispel Quest.

### White Wizard Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours.
2. Take 1d6 damage.
3. Your healing spells have a 2-in-6 chance of harming for a turn.
4. You must watch something die before you can cast a healing spell again.
5. Panic for 1d6 rounds
6. Your hands seize up painfully. You can’t do anything requiring fine motor skills, including casting spells, for 1d6 rounds.

### Doom of the White Wizard

1. You go blind for three days.
2. You cannot cast spells for a week.
3. You lose your mind and become permanently unable to speak or cast spells. Kind party members might relieve you of your wizardly robes and send you off to a monastery.

You can avoid this doom by swearing an oath of non-violence on the heart of an angel or pit fiend.

## Elementalist Wizard

## Illusionist Wizard

[Taken from Skerples' Illusionist Wizards](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/03/osr-illusionist-wizards.html)

**Perk**: Your illusion spells have a duration of “Concentration + 1 minute”. You start with rainbow-coloured gloves.

> The gloves are going to be important in a minute. The duration increase is very, very nice. Other people can cast illusions, but you are an Illusionist.

**Drawback**: You cannot cast spells unless you can see all 7 primary colours. Your magic supplies the 8th: octarine.

> Ah. Right. Pitch darkness is out. Being blind is out. A thick fog is going to make things interesting. Losing your gloves or getting blood all over them is going to be a disaster. Octarine, the Colour of Magic, is stolen from the Discworld series.

**Cantrips**:

1. Create a shower of illusory sparks or a puff of illusory smoke from your hands.
2. Touch another caster’s illusion and make and Opposed Intelligence check. If you succeed, you gain control of the illusion.
3. You always know the position of the sun in the sky.

> (1) is standard wizard theatrics. (3) means you will have trouble getting lost underground. But (2)... is very neat. See that neat illusory drawbridge? It's mine now. Your traps? My traps.

### Illusionist Spell List

> In this setting, spells are creatures. They're spirits that live in a wizard's brain and burst out, doing their duty and then taking a brief vacation. Elementalists have brains like stables or kennels. Illusionists, who rely on more sentient spells, have brains like carnivals or traveling circus wagons. Illusionists feed their spells on coloured light. Illusion spells need all 8 colours to manifest. Any less, and feeble, flickering images will appear from the undernourished spell.

Illusionists get exactly one damage-dealing spell: prismatic ray. It's entirely possible to play an complete pacifist.

If you know something is an illusion, it doesn't vanish. You don't "see through it". It doesn't look any less real. It's like a perfect hologram from Star Trek or one of those really convincing optical illusion, like the hollow mask effect. You can't "roll to disbelieve" an illusion.

If you control an illusion and it is within line of sight, you can change it's nature or form once per round. You could use illusion to create a goblin and then, when pursued, transform it into a tiger. Illusions will still work outside of your line of sight, and will exhibit reasonably correct behaviors. A guard-illusion will march if told to march. A fire-illusion will burn (but not spread). The spells that create illusions are about as intelligent as a dog.

1. Illusion
    * R: 50' T: [dice]x5' diameter D: concentration / concentration+1 minute
    * You create an illusion of whatever object or creature you want. It can move at your will, but cannot make any sound or smell. Illusions can only add, not subtract. They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole.
    > This spell is the default "make an illusory object" spell. Note the area restriction. At 1 dice you can't create a 6' tall illusory human. The spell is deliberately vague.

2. Disguise
    * R: touch T: object D: [dice] hours / concentration+1 minute
    * You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.
    > These disguises are perfect, visually. You can't "see through them", but you can go "Hey, wait a minute, that hill is making a lot of smoke." "Hey, hold on, I'm pretty sure the King had a limp and didn't speak with an accent."

3. Prismatic Ray
    * R: 200' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0
    * Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the target. Roll a d10: 1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half. 2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save negates. 3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, Save for half. 4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, Save for half. 5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, Save for half. 6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum] rounds. Save negates. 7, 8, 9. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save. 10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.
    > This is the only Illusionist spell that deals direct damage, but even at low levels it can deal a lot of damage. At 4 [dice],  you have a 10% chance of dealing 12d6 damage, although Saves will negate some of it.

4. Mirror Image
    * R: 0 T: self D: 10 minutes / concentration+1 minute
    * You create 1d4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll to see if they hit you or an image. An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid impact. Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to vanish.
    > Also useful for intimidating the credulous. Become a multi-wizard.

5. Mirror Object
    * R: touch T: mirror D: [dice] hours  / concentration+1 minute
    * You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object adjacent to the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror (as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were a window) and light enough for you to pull through with one hand. The mirror object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied. It doesn't copy any magical properties of the object. You cannot duplicate living things in this way. The mirror object pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow . If you invest at least 4 [dice] into this spell, it can copy the magical properties of an item, but those magical properties will only function once. For items with continuous properties, such as a flying carpet, the magic properties will last no longer than 10 minutes.
    > The [dice] part of this spell is more or less useless, but everything else is great.

6. Light
    * R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours
    * Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively, you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4 [dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.
    > Light sources in the dungeon are very valuable. At one [dice], this spell is a slightly worse emergency torch, but at two [dice] it is already significantly better. And what does pure octarine light do anyway? At a minimum, I'd say [sum] damage to all sighted creatures in the area, plus whatever mutations, mishaps, summonings, and explosions the GM cares to inflict. Mad Illusionists build special mirror-cages and wear visors tinted with the bones of extremely dull bureaucrats.

7. Hypnotic Orb
    * R: touch T: object D: [sum] minutes / concentration+1 minute
    * You enchant a mostly-spherical object so that it's surface is covered with a captivating, shimmering pattern. Any creature who sees the enchanted object must Save or be compelled to sit still and observe it for the spell's duration. Flying creatures will land or circle it. The caster is not immune to this effect. The effect is broken if line of sight is broken, if something startles a target (a loud adjacent shout), or if the target see signs of obvious danger (such as someone killing their friends). Groups of statistically identical NPCs should make their Saves as a group.
    > I'm sure you can easily imagine a scenario where an Illusionist and friends is preparing to ambush some goblins. The entire group is waiting outside a door. The Illusionist casts this spell. The party fails their Saves and stare at the orb. The goblins turn up and also stare at it. When the spell's duration expires, all hell is going to break loose.

8. Colour Spray
    * R: [dice]x10' cone T: sighted creatures D: 0 / varies
    * If [sum] is equal or greater to the creature's HD, it is befuddled for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is three times the creature's HD or more, it is stunned for a round, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is five times the creature's HD, it is stunned for 1d6 rounds, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds.
    > This spell is a bit variable, and a little fiddly for my tastes, but mass stun effects are nice.

9. Wizard Vision

    * R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent
    * If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.
    * If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above, except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects:
        1. You can forever see invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else.
        2. You can tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.
    * The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6 Wisdom (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6 Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from your peers).
    > Wizard Vision is, as usual, a very good idea stolen from someone else. It makes you a little crazy.

10. Wall of Light
    * R: 50' T: wall or sphere D: 10 min / concentration+1 minute
    * You conjure either
      1. (a) a hemisphere [dice]x5’ in diameter, or
      2. (b) a 10' by 10' panel per [dice], which can be arranged in any contiguous formation joined by their edges. The wall is intangible, but you can control what each side shows. It can be either
         1. (a) inky darkness,
         2. (b) light out to 30',
         3. (c) mirror,
         4. (d) transparency, or
         5. (e) a simple texture, such as stone, brick, or carpet. Both sides do not have to show the same thing. You can change these surfaces with a thought.
      3. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, you may make the duration permanent.
    > Not much of a "wall", as it's intangible, but people don't necessarily know that.

**Emblem Spells**

11. Mirror Self
    * R: touch T: mirror D: concentration / concentration+1 minute
    * You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out [dice] copies of yourself. The mirror must be large enough for you to pass through. Your mirror clones behave as you wish. They can walk and talk, but it cannot pick anything up. You can see through their eyes and hear through its ears. You can cast spells through them. You can switch places with your mirror twin as a free action. A mirror twin pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow.
    > While the "concentration" difficulty of this spell makes spellcasting tricky, I'd say you can regain control if you regain concentration within 1 minute, as an Illusionist. Once you learn this spell, expect the Illusionist in the mirror to reach out and copy you from time to time.

12. Fade
    * R: 50' T: creature or object D: [sum] rounds
    * Target phases out and becomes unable to affect the world in any way except visually. It stands or floats like an illusion until the spell concludes. Not even magic can affect the target. If they would be in a solid object when the spell expires, they are harmlessly shunted into the nearest open space. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell:
      * 1 [dice]: human-sized,
      * 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized,
      * 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized,
      * 4 or more [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.
    > Fade a bridge away. Fade your enemy away and then have the fighter line up for a two-handed baseball bat swing at their neck.

### Illusionist Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Blind for 1d6 rounds
5. All sighted creatures are invisible to you for 24hrs.
6. Eruption of random illusions from your hands. Everyone in LOS must make a Wisdom check to do anything relying on sight for 1d6 rounds.

The first 3 mishaps are the same for every school. (4) means no spellcasting for 1d6 rounds. (5) is hilarious and extremely confusing. (6) is going to be entertaining to narrate, but it affects enemies as well as allies. It's line of sight based as well. If you mishap on top of a tower, everyone is going to stop to watch the fireworks.

### Doom of the Illusionist

1. A 10’ square mirror appears and you are compelled to enter. Your lose a random item, gain a random item of approximately equal value, and have 0 HP. You return the next morning, shivering.
2. You turn into an illusion for a day.
3. Turn into an illusion permanently.

As an illusion, you have no smell or taste. You cannot be felt. Solid impacts cause you to pop. Lose 1d6 Con that cannot be recovered while you are an illusion, and reform the next morning nearby. Illusions are real to you.

> (1) is a neat idea. Mirror realms are always fun. 0 HP isn't the worst penalty either. You'll get some of it back at lunch. (2) and (3) are... really bad. Illusions being real to you does mean you can walk across an illusory bridge or ride an illusory dragon into battle, but you're going to pop a lot.

This doom can be avoided by journeying into the mirror-realm and eating one of the eyes of the beholders found there, or performing the Ritual of Prismax; a duel to the death against three of your mirror selves, fought in a neutral battlefield.

## Necromancer

## Spell-Thief

## Elven Wizard

[Taken from Skerples' Elves and Elf Wizards](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/05/osr-elves-and-elf-wizards.html)

**Perk**: Gain 1 extra MD while touching a tree at least 50`high. Roots count.

**Starting Equipment**: You start with a bow.

> The bow is more important than it sounds. As a low-level elf wizard it will be your only source of damage. The extra MD can potentially be amazing. There aren't many ways to get extra MD in this system and 50' trees are surprisingly common.

**Drawback**: If you are scarred, disfigured, or filthy you must Save each morning or be unable to cast spells that day.

> But here's the big downside. Sleep rough, wake up grubby, and stop being an Elf Wizard for the day. Lose a leg? Get a bad rash? You're effectively demoted. Watch out.

**Cantrips**:

1. Create a pleasant musical ringing sound.
2. Any target you hit with an arrow counts as being at range “Touch” for the purposes of your spells.
3. Touch a wound to prevent it from bleeding. You do not negate any damage, but you to stop blood loss (and remove the Blood Loss condition). Faint white scars will still form.

> Your cantrips are decent. The 1st has many uses. As one of my players said, "When the donging stops, the elf is dead."

In this setting, spells are creatures. Wizards have brain-guns that shoot bullet-ferrets. Elves do things a little differently. Their spells are naturally generated, symbiotic creatures bound to their soul and substance. They still need a spellbook, because you want to keep your spells safe, but their books are elegant gossamer creations embroidered with platinum thread. An Elf Wizard is like a magical sculpture garden or a music box. They are made for entertainment. To a High Elf, that can mean a lot of different things.

### Elven Spell List

Some of these are stolen from Goblin Punch.

1. Clarity
    * R: 30’ T: [dice] creatures D: 0
    * Target makes another Save against a emotion-affecting effect (fear, anger, sadness, pleasure, pain). This can affect yourself.
    > Elves view the world through schoolteacher eyes.
2. Speak with Birds
    * R: 200’ T: birds D: 20 minutes
    * You can talk to a bird, and it can talk back. If there is a party of 3-6 adventurer's moving through the forest nearby, a random songbird has a [sum]x10% chance of knowing where they are and if they're doing anything extra weird. Birds of prey are rarer, but more observant.
    > It's "speak with birds" not "make friends with birds". Your average forest songbird will happily sit on an elf's shoulder and tell them all sorts of Disney-branded secrets. Your average mountain eagle will show up, demand food, scream at you about politics and all the people and sheep it's killed, and then leave in a huff.
3. Blossom
    * R: touch T: plant D: permanent
    * Touched plant flourishes. Seeds germinate, flower-buds swell and bloom, and a sickly plant regains vigor. Heals [sum] HP to a plant creature. If cast on a fruit, the fruit will grow up to the maximum normal size or 2x as big (whichever is smaller). Yes, you can use this to double your rations, as long as your rations are fruit or vegetables.
    > Elves, in this system, also eat half the usual rations (1 per day rather than 2). Using it on food would be a shame though.
4. Illusion of Youth
    * R: touch T: creature D: [dice] days, or, if [sum] > 12, permanent (until death)
    * Touched creature is cloaked with an illusion that makes them appear to be in their physical prime.
    > Elves age slowly, but their last few decades condense a lifetime of ugliness. This spell cloaks you or your companions. You'll probably want to cast if before meeting a High Elf. Remember, you can't "see through" illusions, but you can pop it with a good solid blow.
5. Locate Animal
    * R: [dice] miles T: creature D: [dice] hours
    * Name a common animal. You now know where the nearest example of the animal is.
    > Oh hooray. If the areas is infested with manticores, they count as common creatures.
6. Unseen Orchestra
    * R: 0 T: self D: [sum] minutes
    * You are surrounded by the harmonious sounds of a five-piece band for the duration of the spell. The exact instruments vary caster to caster, and the unseen band can play any song you've heard before. It cannot duplicate speech. You can also opt to center the effect on an adjacent location, rather than on yourself.
    > Bear in mind that you start with 2 of the 6 spells listed above and a bow. Good luck, Elf Wizard!
7. Floral Salvage
    * R: touch T: creature D: 0
    * Flowers (caster chooses the type) erupt from the target's wounds. Target takes 1 damage for every point of damage it has already taken, not exceeding [sum]x2. Save for half. If this damage kills the target, their corpse is entirely consumed by plant growth, and turns into a beautiful tree covered in flowers. Height is 2d4 x creature's HD in feet.
    > And then, possibly as soon as Level 2, Elf Wizards go from "princess jukebox" to "double fireball to the face". Bear in mind that with the bow-related cantrip you can hit a target with an arrow, deal 1d6 damage, and then cast this spell to (at a bare minimum) double your damage. You also get a tree out of it.
8. Beautify
    * R: touch T: creature or object D: [sum] hours >6 permanent
    * Target made more beautiful. Dirt falls away, pimples disappears, teeth whiten, lice vanish, gouges fill in, and varnish looks new again. Will also restore 1d4 points of Charisma if damaged, to former max.
    > While Illusion of Youth is merely an illusion, this is the real deal. You won't get any younger but you and the things you own will look as good as new, or possibly better. Expect Elf Wizards to cast this on themselves openly (just in case), and on their allies (secretly, if required).
9. Magic Missile
    R: 200' T: creature D: 0
    Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no save. As an Elf Wizard, you have to fire this spell using a bow. The spell is the arrow.
    > I don't have much to say about Magic Missile, except that it's clearly an Elf spell humans domesticated.
10. Serpents of the Earth (Elf)
    * R: touch T: section of natural soil or stone D: concentration
    * [Sum] enormous serpents of HD 1d4 crawl up from the dirt. They have Attack 13, Defense, 13 and deal 1d6+HD damage, except for the 1 HD serpents, which are small and bite for 1 damage + deadly poison. Serpents are not controlled by the caster. They're just pissed off snakes.
    > The Authority buried the Primordial Serpents deep within the earth, but Elves know how to call them up again. This is not always a wise idea.

**Emblem Spells**

11. Elegant Judgement
    * R: 200' T: 20’ diameter D: 0
    * Does [sum] damage, Save vs. Charisma for half. Like a fireball, but the flames are purple and gold. Creatures with 17 or more Charisma,  non-sentient creatures, beautiful objects, the dead, or other Elves are immune to this spell.
    > More straight up-damage... or is it? I'm sure there are other uses for this spell.
12. Rain of Arrows
    * R: 200' T: 20’ diameter D: 0
    * Does [sum] damage. As fireball except that the caster fires an arrow into the air (which turns into a multitude) and the damage is all piercing damage. Doesn't work in places with low ceilings (less than 100').
    > Another straight-up damage spell. Really, you're only likely to pick this one if you aren't taking Elegant Judgement or Magic Missile. It's here to give you options.

> If an Elf Wizard can survive to Level 4, they will become one of the more formidable damage-dealing casters in the game. Early levels do not give them tools for survival. It's a very risk-reward setup.

### Elven Mishaps

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Agony 1d6 rounds
5. Blind for 1d6 rounds
6. Lose one MD for 24 hours.

Nothing too shocking here. This is one of the less harsh mishap tables.

### Doom of the Elf Wizard

1. Lose the ability to cast spells for 1 day,
2. Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days. Lose the ability to fire a bow or draw a blade for 3 days.
3. Lose the ability to cast spells permanently. You can wield only your nails and teeth. You can only speak in monosyllables.

This doom can be averted by winning the trust and patronage of a powerful High Elf, or by building a tower near some site of astounding natural beauty.
